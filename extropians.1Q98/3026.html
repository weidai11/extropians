<p>
"Hire your pastor to read the first volume<br>
for you. But don't miss the second." Thus<br>
ends H.L. Mencken's celebrated review of<br>
Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy. The<br>
words apply to George Reisman's defence of<br>
laissez-faire capitalism, Capitalism: A<br>
Treatise on Economics, except that far more<br>
than the equivalent of one out of two volumes<br>
is superfluous to the book's real<br>
contribution, a new vision of the economy as<br>
a whole, with the producer put back into the<br>
central place, which led him to develop a new<br>
system of national income accounting. It is<br>
the stuff of a revolution in economics and a<br>
Nobel Prize for whoever carries it off. I<br>
recommend the huge double-columned book,<br>
however, only to someone who already knows a<br>
good deal of economics and who is ambitious<br>
about carrying forward Reisman's ideas.<br>
<p>
The book is in three major parts. The first<br>
part, "The Foundations of Economics," lays<br>
the ground work. Reisman defines economics as<br>
"the science that studies the production of<br>
wealth under a system of division of labor"<br>
(p. 15) and wealth as "material goods made by<br>
man" (p. 39) and discusses the nature of<br>
capitalism and freedom and the protection of<br>
rights by governments. This part further lays<br>
down basic ideas on the division of labor and<br>
the need for wealth and concludes with a<br>
discussion of the ecology movement.<br>
<p>
The second part, "The Division of Labor and<br>
Capitalism," discusses why an extensive<br>
division of labor is necessary for economic<br>
progress and why capitalism is the necessary<br>
institutional framework for having an<br>
extensive division of labor in the first<br>
place. He shows how a free-market economy<br>
solves the economic coordination problem and<br>
how socialism is impossible. The part goes<br>
into great detail how price controls<br>
backfire, with particular reference to the<br>
energy "crisis" of 1973. And it also argues<br>
why the alleged threat of private monopoly<br>
power is bogus.<br>
<p>
The third part, "The Process of Economic<br>
Progress," is the most original part and<br>
looks at the economy as a whole, with<br>
particular reference to the supply of money<br>
and the importance of having a precious-metal<br>
standard of money. Most of this part consists<br>
of refuting fallacies of other schools of<br>
economic thought, seemingly leaving laissez-<br>
faire capitalism as the remaining<br>
alternative, but a great deal of the part is<br>
given over to expounding the author's<br>
positive conception of the workings of the<br>
economy.<br>
<p>
The book concludes with an Epilogue,<br>
outlining a long-term strategy toward<br>
achieving laissez-faire society. First comes<br>
efforts to educate the public, only later<br>
will it become possible to eliminate<br>
regulation and, more slowly, subsidies and<br>
government jobs. Reisman envisions a<br>
government that spends about a tenth of what<br>
it does today.<br>
<p>
Capitalism and Objectivism<br>
<p>
Capitalism is being touted as an integration<br>
of economics and Ayn Rand's Objectivism. Had<br>
the book done this, it would have been an<br>
even greater achievement than the revolution<br>
the author has begun in putting the producer<br>
into central place in economics (about which<br>
more anon). To be sure, her ideas are<br>
discussed repeatedly in the book, but it does<br>
not deal with her most tantalizing idea<br>
having to do with economics, namely that of<br>
"philosophically objective value," as opposed<br>
to the market-determined "socially objective<br>
value, i.e., the sum of the individual<br>
judgments of all the men involved in trade at<br>
a given time."^ She notes that if a<br>
stenographer "spends all her money on<br>
cosmetics and has none left to pay for the<br>
use of a microscope (for a visit to the<br>
doctor) when she needs it, she learns a<br>
better method of budgeting her income; the<br>
free market serves as her teacher.... The<br>
only thing that a capitalist system requires<br>
of her is the thing that nature requires:<br>
rationality, i.e., that she live and act to<br>
the best of her own judgment." Ayn Rand<br>
speaks of the free market, "which teaches<br>
every participant to look for the objective<br>
best within the category of his own<br>
competence, and penalizes those who act on<br>
irrational considerations."<br>
   ^["What Is the Capitalism?", reprinted in<br>
Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]<br>
<p>
Reisman does speak of "imaginary goods," such<br>
as rabbit's feet and tarot cards, but all he<br>
says is that "the economic principles that<br>
apply to such goods, such as the laws of<br>
price determination, are the same as that<br>
apply to genuine goods" (p. 41). So if it is<br>
true that rabbit's feet do not lead to<br>
satisfaction of objective (in some sense)<br>
desires, then the demand for such feet will<br>
fall and so, very likely, their price.<br>
<p>
There has always been a tension in economics<br>
over the range of applicability of its<br>
supposed principles. On the one hand,<br>
economics presupposes conditions of peace and<br>
the absence of force and fraud. On the other<br>
hand, economists, including Reisman,<br>
regularly analyze the economic consequences<br>
of government intervention using the various<br>
principles that presuppose their absence. A<br>
second reading of Ludwig von Mises' Human<br>
Action left me overwhelmed with the sleights<br>
of hand he performed in this regard: for<br>
example, businessmen, through a mysterious<br>
process called "understanding" (Verstehen),<br>
can readily calculate the effects of<br>
technology-induced changes in the money<br>
supply but are totally miffed by government-<br>
induced inflation! Reisman, much to his<br>
credit, does not engage in this bit of<br>
hermeneutic, phenomenological metaphysics of<br>
Verstehen; still, an axiomatic treatment<br>
could bring out the precise range of economic<br>
principles.<br>
<p>
Now if this ambiguity of the range of<br>
economics is problematic, much more so will<br>
be the distinguishing of Ayn Rand's<br>
"philosophically objective value" from her<br>
market-determined "socially objective value."<br>
The philosophically objective value of an<br>
action is not something that can be directly<br>
read off; rather, its discovery requires<br>
rational thought and investigation, just as<br>
in the discovery of an improved production<br>
process. Both require effort, sometimes<br>
considerable. Whether this effort constitutes<br>
a kind of "cost," I am not prepared to say<br>
and am not sure how Reisman would treat this<br>
matter either, but clearly an integration of<br>
economics and Objectivism would require<br>
consideration of the notion of objectivity in<br>
consumption as well as production. By<br>
contrast, neo-classical economics by and<br>
large presupposes consumer rationality and<br>
has no concern at all with rationality of<br>
ends, except to dismiss it as forever beyond<br>
its purview.<br>
<p>
There is a large literature in economics<br>
about the costs of technological innovation,<br>
mostly consisting of trite statements about<br>
optimizing this or that; I suppose one could<br>
generate any number of trite, mathematics-<br>
filled papers on rationality in consumption.<br>
(It's hard, at times, to blame Reisman and<br>
other Austrians for their disdain for<br>
mathematics, but they vastly overdo it.) The<br>
larger problem of just what rational desires<br>
are would remain after all these papers were<br>
generated, and I am afraid that Objectivists<br>
have not gone beyond stating that all<br>
desires, if they are rational, need to<br>
conform to human nature and need to promote<br>
virtue and character development. (This<br>
second need has been articulated only poorly<br>
so far.) It may be high foolishness to<br>
suppose that Objectivism ought to be more<br>
than a well-organized body of abstract<br>
principles and produce algorithms to enable<br>
one to make specific consumption strategies<br>
or career choices. Still, I would not<br>
arbitrarily demarcate philosophy from the<br>
rest of human inquiry as an excuse for<br>
intellectual laziness.<br>
<p>
Let me urge any scholar willing to tackle the<br>
problem of objective ends to read David<br>
Schmidtz's Rational Choice and Moral Agency<br>
(Princeton University Press, 1995). Schmidtz<br>
argues that we choose not just means to ends<br>
but what he calls "maieutic" ends, which are<br>
ends to find final ends (ends in themselves)<br>
to live for as well. Thus, I want a career<br>
and a wife to devote myself to. The important<br>
thing is not to dally too long in picking the<br>
best career and the best wife but to get on<br>
with it and let these ends grow from being<br>
means to the satisfaction of my desires to<br>
being ends in themselves around which my<br>
desires are organized. This echoes Francisco<br>
d'Anconia's statement that the worst man was<br>
one without a purpose.<br>
<p>
These larger questions about final ends are<br>
general ones for Objectivists, whereas<br>
Reisman says, "I define economics as the<br>
science that studies the production of wealth<br>
under a system of division of labor" (p. 15).<br>
But the issues of career choice and<br>
rationality of consumption ends are relevant<br>
to economics proper. Will a rational consumer<br>
merely purchase what strikes his fancy, or<br>
will his purchases partake of purposefulness<br>
every bit as much as his career?<br>
Unfortunately, I have never seen Ayn Rand's<br>
article on why she collected stamps and<br>
therefore in what sense she found her<br>
collecting to be rationally purposeful. I<br>
urge that the article be made widely<br>
available.<br>
<p>
David Hume, characterized by Miss Rand as<br>
"the Bertrand Russell of his day" (in<br>
contrast to the heavyweight Immanuel Kant),<br>
was nevertheless wise when he spoke of man's<br>
need for work, rest, and relaxation. Recall<br>
that the residents of Galt's Gulch did a<br>
certain amount of high-minded relaxing (going<br>
to concerts and ballets, listening to<br>
lectures), but it did not take the form of<br>
goofing off. I suggest that the "science of<br>
the production of wealth" will discover that<br>
purposeful relaxation redounds to this<br>
production of wealth, while goofing off to<br>
some extent may reduce it.<br>
<p>
Reisman's Signal Achievement<br>
<p>
Enough complaints about what the book did not<br>
do and on to its achievements. What is<br>
revolutionary in his actual accomplishment is<br>
his way of keeping his focus on all the<br>
activity of the economy rather than just upon<br>
the consumer goods that come out at the end<br>
of the process. Sales between businesses for<br>
raw and intermediate products are several<br>
times the size of the end products, and<br>
consideration of the whole keeps the producer<br>
in central place rather than at the margins,<br>
whereas too many economists take production<br>
as a given, to be distributed by "society"<br>
(political pressure groups or "the<br>
aristocracy of pull").<br>
<p>
Reisman develops a new method of national<br>
income accounting on, as he calls it, "an<br>
Aristotelian base" as opposed to the<br>
"Platonic-Heraclitean" view implicitly held<br>
by other economists. Paraphrasing one of Ayn<br>
Rand's favorite sayings (which goes back only<br>
to the Middle Ages, not to Aristotle, by the<br>
way), he tells us that "the demand for A is<br>
the demand for A," whence it is improper to<br>
lump flour, wheat, and labor services into<br>
the final product (bread) and count the last<br>
only when measuring the Gross National<br>
Product. Instead, he adds sales of these<br>
intermediate and final products up, adds in<br>
wages, and calls the sum Gross National<br>
Revenue. He takes the reader through a great<br>
many exercises to show how his new accounting<br>
methods work. His accounts somewhat resemble<br>
the input-output tables of Wassily Leontief<br>
(Nobel Prize, 1973) and the earlier Tableau<br>
êconomique (1st ed., 1758) of the French<br>
Physiocrat Franáois Quesnay, but Reisman<br>
shares not at all their itch to engage in<br>
social planning. Reisman is, of course, a<br>
laissez-faire capitalist.<br>
<p>
The upshot of his analysis is several<br>
remarkable and counterintuitive conclusions<br>
(though not as counterintuitive as those of<br>
Keynes' "multiplier"!). Three of the most<br>
important are that all this spending in the<br>
Gross National Revenue accounts depends on<br>
how much money there is, not upon how<br>
productive the economic system is. And<br>
profits, as well as interest rates, are<br>
determined, not by productivity, but by the<br>
proportion of investment to consumption,<br>
which is ultimately tied to the (time)<br>
preference for present goods to future goods.<br>
Time horizons broaden as men are more<br>
rational and property is secure. In such a<br>
case, the rate of profit and interest is low,<br>
under three percent per year during large<br>
stretches of the nineteenth century. Third,<br>
he puts to rest the Marxist notion that<br>
profits necessarily decline over time. This<br>
last is so at variance with the facts that<br>
its continued propagation is a real puzzle,<br>
but it has been supported by (I learned from<br>
Reisman) a very large number of bad but<br>
influential arguments.<br>
<p>
Reisman's Other Achievements<br>
<p>
Much of the book--too much--is given over to<br>
refuting bad arguments rather than<br>
constructing something positive. But the<br>
refutation of Marx's still highly-<br>
influential theory of exploitation by<br>
capitalists is original. To show this,<br>
Reisman goes back to fundamental concepts,<br>
something that Ayn Rand endlessly encouraged:<br>
profits are just revenues minus the costs^ of<br>
the things produced, and wages are monies<br>
paid in exchange for the performance of labor<br>
not for the products of labor. A businessman<br>
is, therefore, not a wage earner, even if<br>
some economists "impute" a wage to him that<br>
he supposedly pays himself. This means that<br>
farmers, artisans, and everyone who did<br>
productive work were all businessmen and<br>
earned profits (selling their products for<br>
more than they paid for the raw materials),<br>
until the first capitalist employed a laborer<br>
for hire. (Strikingly and long before<br>
Reisman, the great German sociologist, Max<br>
Weber, demarcated capitalism by the free<br>
mobility of labor--that is, by how the<br>
capital was used--not by trade or the free<br>
mobility of money itself, both of which are<br>
quite old.) The upshot is that there is no<br>
"exploitation" here but instead the<br>
benevolent (one of Reisman's favorite words<br>
and more apt than "beneficial") offering of<br>
opportunities to sell one's labor rather than<br>
its products.<br>
   ^[Costs are just outlays here, not so-<br>
called opportunity costs, a notion Reisman<br>
makes mince meat of. This is another side<br>
accomplishment of his book.]<br>
<p>
There are other refutations aplenty, from<br>
Keynesianism (focuses almost entirely on the<br>
consumer), alleged free-market monopoly (even<br>
so, buyers would shift to long-term<br>
contracts), wage and price controls (not even<br>
politicians believe in this anymore), the oil<br>
"crisis" (also a dead issue), and<br>
environmentalism (at least the zanier<br>
aspects), to various ideas held by earlier<br>
economists, esp. those of Smith, Ricardo, and<br>
Mill, from which Reisman extracts the best<br>
and makes it his own.<br>
<p>
Indeed, some of his criticisms of other<br>
economists, whole schools of them even, are<br>
so strong that I am not sure what is left<br>
standing. Neo-classical economics (what I had<br>
in graduate school) comes in for especial<br>
criticism, but I did not learn from<br>
Capitalism whether there is any merit to<br>
those handy supply-and-demand diagrams and<br>
less-handy indifference curves, and, if so,<br>
how they can be deployed legitimately. Just<br>
what are the fundamental concepts and<br>
assumptions of neo-classical economics<br>
anyhow? I've seen certain mathematical<br>
treatments, but these are never connected to<br>
the world via semantic assumptions<br>
(correspondence rules) in any rigorous<br>
fashion, as Mario Bunge insists in his<br>
monumental Treatise on Basic Philosophy that<br>
they should be.<br>
<p>
Some Criticisms<br>
<p>
I can get a little suspicious about some of<br>
Reisman's own conclusions, too, for his own<br>
lack of rigor. The numerical examples he<br>
takes the readers through may work only<br>
because he has unintendedly built in<br>
assumptions that make them work. (He often<br>
gives algebraic formulae, but they are not<br>
placed in an axiomatic format and hence need<br>
to be rigorously checked. Hint to future<br>
scholars: back-calculate the underlying<br>
production functions.) Economics, after all,<br>
is an empirical science, and any science must<br>
connect up to the world at multiple places<br>
and not just to contrived examples and to the<br>
broad historical generalizations Reisman<br>
offers. A genuine science must also lay out<br>
its assumptions in the best possible fashion<br>
using the axiomatic method, and a genuine<br>
scientist must keep up to date with the<br>
literature. (See, esp., Mario Bunge, "The<br>
Axiomatic Format" and "Examples and<br>
Advantages of Axiomatics," chapters 7 and 8<br>
in Mario Bunge, Philosophy of Physics<br>
(Dordrecht, Holland: D. Reidel, 1973). These<br>
chapters deal with science generally, not<br>
just physics.)<br>
<p>
Furthermore, the economic realm is<br>
continuous, while our concepts are discrete.<br>
So it is not good enough to just decree what<br>
gets counted in the money supply and what is<br>
merely "near money," as Reisman does on page<br>
540. But on pages 995-6, he recognizes that<br>
different definitions of money can differ in<br>
explanatory power. Yet he rather often speaks<br>
disparagingly of "so-called empirical<br>
research" that might test for just this<br>
explanatory power and seems wholly unaware<br>
that there are several formulae for<br>
constructing weighted averages, the merits of<br>
which make up a large sub-literature in<br>
economics journals.<br>
<p>
Ayn Rand's notion of a true definition<br>
(foreshadowed by the great Charles Peirce) as<br>
capturing those characteristics of the thing<br>
defined that maximize (scientific)<br>
explanatory power is well-recognized by<br>
Reisman. But just to proffer definitions is<br>
not enough: one must demonstrate that the<br>
purported definition indeed has this property<br>
of maximizing explanatory power. As it<br>
happens, concept refinement is every bit as<br>
important to science as the usual<br>
undertakings of induction and deduction.<br>
Forming concepts takes hard work and whenever<br>
a purported definition departs from the true<br>
one even slightly, our sciences stray farther<br>
and farther away from reality at a geometric<br>
rate as we merrily proceed link by link down<br>
long deductive chains.<br>
<p>
Who Should Read the Book?<br>
<p>
Again, a reviewer should not complain too<br>
much about a book's omissions. (I peppered my<br>
copy of the book with enough critical remarks<br>
to give anyone seeing them a severe to fatal<br>
sneezing fit.) In the end, it's the<br>
achievements that count. The refutations are<br>
generally very fine, but far more important<br>
is the book's tremendous potential, a Nobel<br>
Prize even, for a scholar who wants to<br>
develop the positive ideas on revamping the<br>
national income accounts and, effectively,<br>
redoing macro-economics from the ground up.<br>
As for integrating economics and Objectivism,<br>
it's Objectivism that needs to be better<br>
developed, especially in the realm of<br>
psychology.<br>
<p>
I recommend the book urgently to any<br>
Objectivist pursuing a career as an academic<br>
economist or considering it and who is<br>
willing to sweat through the book (not just<br>
read it as I did), willing to dig out the<br>
essential arguments and put them on a firm<br>
mathematical and axiomatic basis, and above<br>
all willing to argue, argue, and argue with<br>
his peers in the economics profession. He'll<br>
have to keep up to date and fill in on all<br>
the developments in the field since Reisman<br>
completed his dissertation in 1963,<br>
developments in the economic analysis of<br>
politics (Public Choice theory), the economic<br>
analysis of law, and new learning about how<br>
businessmen counteract the effects of<br>
regulation (Rational Expectations).^ Above<br>
all, he who would develop Reisman's ideas<br>
cannot be like Reisman himself, who would say<br>
that Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki "are<br>
advocates of socialism, while I, of course,<br>
am an advocate of laissez-faire capitalism.<br>
Because of this I could never conceive of<br>
cooperating with them in any manner, and thus<br>
I never attempted to contact Mrs. Robinson"<br>
(p. 803). Alas such dismissiveness only<br>
becomes exaggerated in those who associate<br>
themselves with the Ayn Rand Institute, as<br>
Reisman himself once did.<br>
   ^[Regards Rational Expectations, see J.W.<br>
Henry Watson and Ida Walters, "The New<br>
Economics and the Death of Central Banking,"<br>
Liberty 10.6 (1997 July): 19-26, for a fine<br>
summary.]<br>
<p>
For any other reader, I cannot so strongly<br>
recommend the book. This is not for what it<br>
does accomplish, nor for what it refutes, nor<br>
for the picture it gives of how the economy<br>
works, nor for the wit that pops up<br>
frequently, but because it is too long and<br>
reading it comes at the "cost" of not reading<br>
a dozen shorter books. Mencken, Dreiser's<br>
greatest defender, in his generally laudatory<br>
review, nevertheless called Dreiser's novel<br>
"this present shapeless and forbidding<br>
monster--a heaping carload of raw materials<br>
for a novel, with rubbish of all sorts<br>
intermixed--a vast, sloppy, chaotic thing of<br>
385,000 words--at least 250,000 of them<br>
unnecessary," but in the context of overall<br>
high praise. I am compelled to say something<br>
not entirely dissimilar of George Reisman's<br>
Capitalism: it is the stuff of a revolution,<br>
but.... Alas, a very great deal of it is<br>
written at the level of high school students<br>
(as is so much of the material put out by the<br>
Ayn Rand Institute), yet other parts<br>
presuppose an advanced knowledge of the<br>
history of economics thought and the<br>
technicalities of both micro- and<br>
macroeconomics as taught in graduate schools.<br>
Indeed, it is hard to discern the target<br>
audience for the book, since the doctrines of<br>
the neoclassical orthodoxy are only referred<br>
to and not spelt out the way a less than<br>
advanced reader would need. I cannot help but<br>
think that Reisman might have carried out his<br>
own revolution had he not wasted so many<br>
years being involved in said Institute, which<br>
in the end did him no good, since he was<br>
purged himself.<br>
<p>
It would be better for most prospective<br>
readers to first read a dozen other books on<br>
economics and before tackling Reisman's<br>
mammoth work. I am not the best to recommend<br>
current books to learn economics, since I<br>
have actually read very few of those now in<br>
print and sold, say, by Laissez Faire Books.<br>
Go through a text in price theory and<br>
actually do the homework. Beyond that, aim<br>
for as broad an understanding of the<br>
economist's way of thinking as you can.<br>
Economics is not all that intuitive, since<br>
our hunting past seems to have instilled in<br>
us the general perspective of command<br>
economies--not so far from the truth when<br>
getting on with the work by following orders<br>
was not much better or worse than innovating<br>
from a very small knowledge base. (I hasten<br>
to add that command economies became<br>
obsolete, surely by the time of agriculture,<br>
if not already by the time that hunting bands<br>
coalesced into tribes.) Thinking like an<br>
economist, in other words, requires<br>
disciplined study.<br>
<p>
The first book I ever read on economics,<br>
Henry Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson,<br>
remains an excellent first choice. I can<br>
commend any book by Gordon Tullock and urge<br>
you later on to read Richard Posner's<br>
Economic Analysis of Law, not to further<br>
enlighten you but to show you how disciplined<br>
thinking can lead to "educated incapacity":<br>
to me, this book is a bad caricature of the<br>
economist's mind-set! Definitely include<br>
James M. Buchanan's What Should Economists<br>
Do? In my own specialty within economics,<br>
Public Choice theory (the application of<br>
economics to group decisions), I'd include<br>
the first two classics, Anthony Downs, An<br>
Economic Theory of Democracy, and Buchanan<br>
and Tullock's The Calculus of Consent. Follow<br>
them with Buchanan's magnum opus, The Limits<br>
of Liberty. Try some books that inspire, such<br>
as Burton W. Folsom, Jr., The Myth of the<br>
Robber Barons (in print) and John<br>
Chamberlain, The Enterprising Americans (out<br>
of print). I do not have to recommend Ayn<br>
Rand's Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, to the<br>
readers here. Finally, you should probably<br>
have the classics of Smith, Ricardo, and Mill<br>
under your belt before you tackle Reisman.<br>
<p>
I am sorry to render the verdict that readers<br>
not start their study of economics with<br>
Reisman's book, but if the right reader<br>
already knowledgeable of the field can be<br>
found, the enormous effort put into<br>
Capitalism by the author will have been more<br>
than rewarded. And so will the economics<br>
profession and the world. Mencken on Dreiser<br>
again: "It takes a kind of skill that is<br>
surely not common. Good writing is far<br>
easier." Original thinking in economics is<br>
also far easier than good writing. Reisman's<br>
book contains a great many original thoughts<br>
but is badly overwritten in most places and<br>
underwritten where it matters most. It takes<br>
someone with a fair amount of knowledge to<br>
grasp what may or may not be original and<br>
merits further development. Get the knowledge<br>
needed to fully profit from Reisman's book<br>
first; then, if you are ambitious, get<br>
Reisman.<br>
