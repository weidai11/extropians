<p>The Ziff-Davis Guide To Britishers (and other foreigners)
<br>
By Andrew Orlowski
<br>
Posted: 28/11/2001 at 20:30 GMT
<br>
<p>The mighty Ziff-Davis publishing empire has chalked up many triumphs over
<br>
the years, but one masterpiece from 1943 has been sadly neglected.
<br>
<p>It's the Manual of Foreign Dialects for Radio, Stage and Screen, by Lewis
<br>
Herman and Maguerite Shalett Herman, published in Chicago.
<br>
<p>As the title suggests, it's a manual for speaking English in a foreign
<br>
accent. Think Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins. He clearly hadn't take notice
<br>
of Herman and Herman, and cinema history would have been different, and we'd
<br>
have been spared if a generation of bit-part actors playing to national
<br>
stereotypes, while they gurn away in comedy accents, if this fine manual had
<br>
been heeded.
<br>
<p>&quot;When all of the elements have been learned progressively, the result should
<br>
be finished and authentic dialect,&quot; write the authors.
<br>
<p>But the guide also schools the thesp with a broad and balanced view of the
<br>
world, too. Many of the dialects have heart-warming descriptions of the
<br>
national character, to better give the student a feel for the nation's rich
<br>
heritage and temperament. We offer a selection below, with a simple
<br>
pronunciation test taken directly from the manual:-
<br>
<p>The Britisher
<br>
&quot;The widely acceptable prototype Britisher has a stolidity, for instance,
<br>
that makes for heavy almost humorless, humor&quot;
<br>
<p>Humorless humor? How true. &quot;He cannot appreciate the humor in others, nor
<br>
the humor in himself&quot;.
<br>
<p>Your Brit is honourable, but basically useless: &quot;he has an eye for business,
<br>
but will not debase his honor to achieve it.&quot; However the British display
<br>
great fortitude in times of crisis, which Herman and Herman attribute to
<br>
&quot;the tradition of dressing for dinner no matter what&quot;.
<br>
<p>&quot;A great many Englishmen suffer from stammering,&quot; the authors observe, and
<br>
helpfully include a section on how to stammer correctly in British.
<br>
<p>And remember: to attract an Englishman's attention, the equivalent of the
<br>
American &quot;Hey&quot; is &quot;I say!&quot;, pronounced AHi-sEH-EE!.
<br>
<p>The Italians
<br>
&quot;The word 'Italian' brings to many minds the picture of an olive-skinned
<br>
person with flashing black eyes, a dramatic talent for gesticulation, a
<br>
fiery temper and warm, full lips that are always open in song - Verdi's
<br>
songs,&quot; say the Hermans.
<br>
<p>Is the picture true?
<br>
<p>&quot;Generally speaking,&quot; the authors tell us. But in the North, they observe,
<br>
Italians are fairer-haired and &quot;observe more self control.&quot; Fortunately,
<br>
though, like the Southern Italians, the Northerners' lips also are &quot;always
<br>
open in song - Verdi's songs&quot;.
<br>
<p>Pronounce this: Signorelli has a fine bambino
<br>
Like this: Eezuh fILnuh bAH:mbEEnAW sEEnyAWrAYlEE gAW:duh
<br>
<p>The Scottish
<br>
Generously, the stereotypical meanness attributed to the Scots is much
<br>
maligned and false, reckon the Hermans.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;to satisfy the Scotsman: give him a pipeful of plug cut,
<br>
a bottle of Scotch whisky, a bowl of oatmeal porridge in the morning, a
<br>
haggis pudding at Christmas, the skirling of the bagpipes on all occasions -
<br>
and he's a contented man.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nothing wrong with that at all, agrees Reg editor John Lettice.
<br>
<p>Pronounce: Taskmaster; Oatmeal; Stomach Ache
<br>
Like this: tOs'mOSthuhr, AW/mi:l, stoomah/EHi/
<br>
<p>The Germans
<br>
&quot;To synthesize the German character,&quot; note our heroic authors, &quot;it can be
<br>
said that he approximates the Russian or Polish peasant except that he has
<br>
been damned with a brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;He reveres, almost to idolatory, the use of honorary titles: 'Herr Dockor
<br>
Direktor General Schultz', where we would say simply, 'Mr Shultz'&quot;. But
<br>
underneath though, he's a softy. Or as they put it: &quot;he is actually a
<br>
sentimental weakling and will weep tears into his wurtzburger brau at the
<br>
strains of a waltz.&quot; Unlike most (but as we'll see, not all) of their
<br>
quick-witted European neighbours, or Americans, the German is &quot;slow to
<br>
thought, slow to action and slow to speech.&quot; The authors blame &quot;an inbred
<br>
inferiority complex&quot;.
<br>
<p>Hegel causes the authors a dilemma, but they conclude that this &quot;abstruse
<br>
thinker&quot; is a representative German after all. It's logic, but logic that's
<br>
&quot;practically unintelligible&quot;.
<br>
<p>Pronounce: (No.10 [p.183]): They were going to the concentration camp
<br>
Like this: dtOO dtUH gkAWnsEHndtrAY:shUHn gkEHmbp dtAY: vfAWs
<br>
gkOH:ingk
<br>
<p>The 'Pert and Nimble' Cockney
<br>
Never confuse a Cockney with a Britisher. But who or what is a Cockney?
<br>
<p>&quot;Technically, anyone living in London,&quot; they advise. &quot;He's a brash little
<br>
fellow ... an inveterate heckler.&quot; You can spot a Cockney by his nasalized
<br>
speech, &quot;possibly because of the adenoid trouble which is quite prevalent in
<br>
the British Isles.&quot; The plucky chap is &quot;a funny little fellow&quot;, cheery in
<br>
adversity, but when he's bad, &quot;he's a rat&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sample phrase: Take the blooming horse home
<br>
Pronounced: tI:k Thuh bliOOminAW sAOWm
<br>
<p>The Pole
<br>
Being allies in 1943, when this masterpiece was published, doesn't help the
<br>
Poles much.
<br>
In fact, the Pole is &quot;slow to thought, slow to speech and slow to action&quot;.
<br>
Sound familiar? His speech is &quot;heavy, slow and hesitant... it oozes out
<br>
heavily, stolidly - like viscous oil instead of bubbling spring water.&quot;
<br>
<p>Poles are &quot;stolid and unimaginative&quot;, and the women &quot;bovine&quot;, so the speech
<br>
must reflect the character and appearance, they wisely tell us.
<br>
<p>Rather rashly however, the test phrases they offer include one that could
<br>
cause a food riot:-
<br>
<p>Sample phrase: There are four sandwiches in your box
<br>
Pronounced: is fAWr sOnvwitch in bAWks
<br>
<p>The French
<br>
On the whole the French are likeable.
<br>
<p>But beware: the French hate the high-life and luxury, warn the authors. Life
<br>
in France is &quot;frugal to the nth degree&quot; and the typical Frenchman so mean,
<br>
that his &quot;penny-penching would shame even the proverbially 'tight'
<br>
Scotsman.&quot; But the literature is witty and frivolous, he's a frank Franc,
<br>
and even the French criminal &quot;is more intelligent than the average&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sample Phrase: Is my hat fashionable?
<br>
Pronounced: mI'AHT, EE zEEt shEEk?
<br>
<p>The Swedes
<br>
Wouldn't you know it? It's the place of &quot;Smorgasbord and the Midnight Sun&quot;!
<br>
<p>But the Swedes have the authors in a giddy swoon. Maybe it's their &quot;gay
<br>
spirit&quot;? Their &quot;light heartedness&quot;? Or their &quot;bubbling sense of humour&quot;? Who
<br>
knows, but &quot;they're very likeable&quot;, exhibiting none of their neighbours'
<br>
&quot;dour Norwegian moodiness&quot;. Maybe it's because that's why the Swedes are
<br>
neat, industrious, and the most intelligent and progressive people in
<br>
Europe.
<br>
<p>Well done!
<br>
<p>Sample Phrase: John is as cross as a bear
<br>
Pronounced: yAW:n A:r sOH: krO: s Il:k AH bA:
<br>
<p>Now Talk Proper
<br>
And so it goes through, Yiddish, Beche le Mar and Pidgin and a dozen other
<br>
dialects. But there's no place for the Welsh - because as every American
<br>
knows it's part of England. (It must be, because we're always being told
<br>
Alan Cox &quot;lives in England&quot;, see). And the Finns and Hungarians get half a
<br>
page each.
<br>
<p>As Charles Laughton's voice coach Garson Kanin writes in the foreword to the
<br>
Manual: &quot;Superficial theatrical clichés must be abruptly discarded - too
<br>
often they tend to ridicule than represent.&quot;
<br>
<p>Indeed, and there's no danger of that here. We'd like to post more excerpts,
<br>
but with the international political situation so delicate right now, it
<br>
could tip us over the brink.
