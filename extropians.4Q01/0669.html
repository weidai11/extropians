<p>COVER STORY: &quot;Ground Zero and the Saudi Connection&quot;
<br>
by Stephen Schwartz 
<br>
<p>(On the extreme Islamic sect that inspires Osama bin Laden as well as all Muslim suicide bombers - and is subsidised by Saudi Arabia.)
<br>
<p>&quot;The first thing to do when trying to understand 'Islamic suicide
<br>
bombers' is to forget the cliches about the Muslim taste for
<br>
martyrdom. It does exist, of course, but the desire for paradise is
<br>
not a safe guide to what motivated the appalling suicide attacks on
<br>
New York and Washington last week.
<br>
<p>Throughout history, political extremists of all faiths have willingly
<br>
Given up their lives simply in the belief that by doing so, whether
<br>
in bombings or in other forms of terror, they would change the
<br>
course of history, or at least win an advantage for their cause.
<br>
Tamils are not Muslims, but they blow themselves up in their war
<br>
on the government of Sri Lanka; Japanese kamikaze pilots in the
<br>
second world war were not Muslims, but they flew their fighters
<br>
into US aircraft carriers. The Islamofascist ideology of Osama bin
<br>
Laden and those closest to him, such as the Egyptian and Algerian
<br>
'Islamic Groups', is no more intrinsically linked to Islam or Islamic
<br>
civilisation than Pearl Harbor was to Buddhism, or Ulster terrorists
<br>
&nbsp;-whatever they may profess - are to Christianity. Serious Christians
<br>
don't go around killing and maiming the innocent; devout Muslims
<br>
do not prepare for paradise by hanging out in strip bars and getting
<br>
drunk, as one of last week's terrorist pilots was reported to have
<br>
done.
<br>
<p>The attacks of 11 September are simply not compatible with
<br>
orthodox Muslim theology, which cautions soldiers 'in the way of
<br>
Allah' to fight their enemies face-to-face, without harming non-
<br>
combatants, women or children. Most Muslims, not only in
<br>
America and Britain, but in the world, are clearly law-abiding
<br>
citizens of their countries - a point stressed by President Bush
<br>
and other American leaders, much to their credit. Nobody on this
<br>
side of the water wants a repeat of the lamented 1941 internment
<br>
of Japanese Americans. Still, the numerical preponderance of
<br>
Muslims as perpetrators of these ghastly incidents is no coincidence.
<br>
<p>So we have to ask ourselves what has made these men into the
<br>
monsters they are? What has so galvanised violent tendencies in
<br>
the world's second-largest religion (and, in America, the fastest
<br>
growing faith)? Can it really flow from a quarrel over a bit of land
<br>
in the Middle East? For Westerners, it seems natural to look for
<br>
answers in the distant past, beginning with the Crusades. But if
<br>
you ask educated, pious, traditional but forward-looking Muslims
<br>
what has driven their umma, or global community, in this direction,
<br>
many of them will answer you with one word: Wahhabism.
<br>
<p>This is a strain of Islam that emerged not at the time of the
<br>
Crusades, nor even at the time of the anti-Turkish wars of the 17th
<br>
century, but less than two centuries ago. It is violent, it is
<br>
intolerant, and it is fanatical beyond measure. It originated in
<br>
Arabia, and it is the official theology of the Gulf states.
<br>
Wahhabism is the most extreme form of Islamic fundamentalism,
<br>
and its followers are called Wahhabis. Not all Muslims are suicide
<br>
bombers, but all Muslim suicide bombers are Wahhabis - except,
<br>
perhaps, for some disciples of atheist leftists posing as Muslims in
<br>
the interests of personal power, such as Yasser Arafat or Saddam
<br>
Hussein. Wahhabism is the Islamic equivalent of the most extreme
<br>
Protestant sectarianism. It is puritan, demanding punishment for
<br>
those who enjoy any form of music except the drum, and severe
<br>
punishment up to death for drinking or sexual transgressions. It
<br>
condemns as unbelievers those who do not pray, a view that never
<br>
previously existed in mainstream Islam. It is stripped-down Islam,
<br>
calling for simple, short prayers, undecorated mosques, and the
<br>
uprooting of gravestones (since decorated mosques and graveyards
<br>
lend themselves to veneration, which is idolatry in the Wahhabi
<br>
mind). Wahhabis do not even permit the name of the Prophet
<br>
Mohammed to be inscribed in mosques, nor do they allow his
<br>
birthday to be celebrated. Above all, they hate ostentatious
<br>
spirituality, much as Protestants detest the veneration of miracles
<br>
and saints in the Roman Church. Ibn Abdul Wahhab (1703-92), the
<br>
founder of this totalitarian Islamism, was born in Uyaynah, in the
<br>
part of Arabia known as Nejd, where Riyadh is today, and which
<br>
the Prophet himself notably warned would be a source of
<br>
corruption and confusion. (Anti-Wahhabi Muslims refer to
<br>
Wahhabism as fitna an Najdiyyah or 'the trouble out of Nejd'.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the beginning of Wahhab's dispensation, in the late 18th
</em><br>
century, his cult was associated with the mass murder of all who
<br>
opposed it. For example, the Wahhabis fell upon the city of
<br>
Qarbala in 1801 and killed 2,000 ordinary citizens in the streets
<br>
and markets. In the 19th century, Wahhabism took the form of
<br>
Arab nationalism v. the Turks. The founder of the Saudi kingdom,
<br>
Ibn Saud, established Wahhabism as its official creed. Much has
<br>
been made of the role of the US in 'creating' Osama bin Laden
<br>
through subsidies to the Afghan mujahedin, but as much or more
<br>
could be said in reproach of Britain which, three generations
<br>
before, supported the Wahhabi Arabs in their revolt against the
<br>
Ottomans. Arab hatred of the Turks fused with Wahhabi ranting
<br>
against the 'decadence' of Ottoman Islam. The truth is that the
<br>
Ottoman khalifa reigned over a multinational Islamic umma in
<br>
which vast differences in local culture and tradition were tolerated.
<br>
No such tolerance exists in Wahhabism, which is why the concept
<br>
of US troops on Saudi soil so inflames bin Laden.
<br>
<p>Bin Laden is a Wahhabi. So are the suicide bombers in Israel. So
<br>
are his Egyptian allies, who exulted as they stabbed foreign tourists
<br>
to death at Luxor not many years ago, bathing in blood up to their
<br>
elbows and emitting blasphemous cries of ecstasy. So are the
<br>
Algerian Islamist terrorists whose contribution to the purification
<br>
of the world consisted of murdering people for such sins as running
<br>
a movie projector or reading secular newspapers. So are the
<br>
Taleban-style guerrillas in Kashmir who murder Hindus. The
<br>
Iranians are not Wahhabis, which partially explains their slow but
<br>
Undeniable movement towards moderation and normality after a
<br>
period of utopian and puritan revivalism. But the Taleban practise
<br>
a variant of Wahhabism. In the Wahhabi fashion they employ
<br>
ancient punishments - such as execution for moral offences - and
<br>
they have a primitive and fearful view of women. The same is true
<br>
of Saudi Arabia's rulers. None of this extremism has been inspired
<br>
by American fumblings in the world, and it has little to do with the
<br>
tragedies that have beset Israelis and Palestinians.
<br>
<p>But the Wahhabis have two weaknesses of which the West is
<br>
largely unaware; an Achilles' heel on each foot, so to speak. The
<br>
first is that the vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful
<br>
people who would prefer the installation of Western democracy in
<br>
their own countries. They loathe Wahhabism for the same reason
<br>
any patriarchal culture rejects a violent break with tradition. And
<br>
that is the point that must be understood: bin Laden and other
<br>
Wahhabis are not defending Islamic tradition; they represent an
<br>
ultra-radical break in the direction of a sectarian utopia. Thus, they
<br>
are best described as Islamofascists, although they have much in
<br>
common with Bolsheviks.
<br>
<p>The Bengali Sufi writer Zeeshan Ali has described the situation
<br>
touchingly: 'Muslims from Bangladesh in the US, just like any
<br>
other place in the world, uphold the traditional beliefs of Islam
<br>
but, due to lack of instruction, keep quiet when their beliefs are
<br>
attacked by Wahhabis in the US who all of a sudden become
<br>
&quot;better&quot; Muslims than others. These Wahhabis go even further
<br>
and accuse their own fathers of heresy, sin and unbelief. And the
<br>
young children of the immigrants, when they grow up in this
<br>
country, get exposed only to this one-sided version of Islam and
<br>
are led to think that this is the only Islam. Naturally a big gap is
<br>
being created every day that silence is only widening.' The young,
<br>
divided between tradition and the call of the new, opt for 'Islamic
<br>
revolution' and commit themselves to their self-destruction,
<br>
combined with mass murder. The same influences are brought
<br>
to bear throughout the ten-million-strong Muslim community in
<br>
America, as well as those in Europe.
<br>
<p>In the US, 80 per cent of mosques are estimated by the Sufi
<br>
Hisham al-Kabbani, born in Lebanon and now living in the US, to
<br>
be under the control of Wahhabi imams, who preach extremism,
<br>
and this leads to the other point of vulnerability: Wahhabism is
<br>
subsidised by Saudi Arabia, even though bin Laden has sworn to
<br>
destroy the Saudi royal family. The Saudis have played a double
<br>
game for years, more or less as Stalin did with the West during the
<br>
second world war. They pretended to be allies in a common
<br>
struggle against Saddam Hussein while they spread Wahhabi
<br>
ideology everywhere Muslims are to be found, just as Stalin
<br>
promoted an 'antifascist' coalition with the US while carrying out
<br>
espionage and subversion on American territory. The motive was
<br>
the same: the belief that the West was or is decadent and doomed.
<br>
<p>One major question is never asked in American discussions of
<br>
Arab terrorism: what is the role of Saudi Arabia? The question
<br>
cannot be asked because American companies depend too much on
<br>
the continued flow of Saudi oil, while American politicians have
<br>
become too cozy with the Saudi rulers. Another reason it is not
<br>
asked is that to expose the extent of Saudi and Wahhabi influence
<br>
on American Muslims would deeply compromise many Islamic
<br>
clerics in the US. But it is the most significant question Americans
<br>
should be asking themselves today. If we get rid of bin Laden, who
<br>
do we then have to deal with? The answer was eloquently put by
<br>
Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, professor of political science at the
<br>
University of California at San Diego, and author of an
<br>
authoritative volume on Islamic extremism in Pakistan, when he
<br>
said: 'If the US wants to do something about radical Islam, it has to
<br>
deal with Saudi Arabia. The &quot;rogue states&quot; [Iraq, Libya, etc.] are
<br>
less important in the radicalisation of Islam than Saudi Arabia.
<br>
Saudi Arabia is the single most important cause and supporter of
<br>
radicalisation, ideologisation, and the general fanaticisation of
<br>
Islam.' From what we now know, it appears not a single one of the
<br>
suicide pilots in New York and Washington was Palestinian. They
<br>
all seem to have been Saudis, citizens of the Gulf states, Egyptian
<br>
or Algerian. Two are reported to have been the sons of the former
<br>
second secretary of the Saudi embassy in Washington. They were
<br>
planted in America long before the outbreak of the latest
<br>
Palestinian intifada; in fact, they seem to have begun their
<br>
conspiracy while the Middle East peace process was in full, if
<br>
short, bloom. Anti-terror experts and politicians in the West must
<br>
now consider the Saudi connection.&quot;
