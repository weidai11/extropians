<p>&nbsp;I WAS SEDUCED BY 48 ROBOTS IN A METALLIC ARENA

<br>
&nbsp;Donald Rumsfeld's on TV with the Pentagon propaganda line of the day.
<br>
&nbsp;This time it's those staged photos of special-ops forces on horseback
<br>
&nbsp;in Afghanistan, or maybe Hollywood: a perfect cinematic realization
<br>
&nbsp;of Bush's religious invocation for a new crusade &quot;against evil.&quot; Jack
<br>
&nbsp;Valenti and Karl Rove are somewhere in the background of the media
<br>
&nbsp;scan smirking over this quick deployment of the image-machine to get
<br>
&nbsp;that just right down and dirty western lands feel of a posse on the
<br>
&nbsp;hunt for the bad guys.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Suddenly, the tech ecstasy of the flare-out days of the 20th century
<br>
&nbsp;has switched into a dark, bleak future of total control.
<br>
&nbsp;And the crowds roar.
<br>
&nbsp;They love it. They demand it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It's a simulacrum of a truly frightened population: mesmerized by
<br>
&nbsp;terrorism yet comforted by the surveillance regimes of the
<br>
&nbsp;disciplinary state. Ethnic scapegoating is in, and snitching's making
<br>
&nbsp;a comeback from its halcyon days of McCarthyism. Recently, the FBI
<br>
&nbsp;had to shut down its hot line for snitchers because of the
<br>
&nbsp;overwhelming response of neighbours snitching on neighbours, friends
<br>
&nbsp;on friends, strangers on strangers, families on families, even
<br>
&nbsp;citizens snitching on themselves.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Demands for total surveillance are everywhere.
<br>
&nbsp;The legitimacy of torture is a debatable subject among members of the
<br>
&nbsp;virtual class.
<br>
&nbsp;A deep chill is in the air:
<br>
&nbsp;of the body, of the borg, of America, of the world.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Electronic Art as Political Theory
<br>
&nbsp;----------------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telefonica.es/fat/vida4/einfo.html">http://www.telefonica.es/fat/vida4/einfo.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;What's the significance of digital art in a time of political crisis?
<br>
&nbsp;A probe of the future or a repetition of the tech ecstasy of the
<br>
&nbsp;quickly vanished past? What does art, particularly big-machine
<br>
&nbsp;robotic performance art, have to tell us about issues of surveillance
<br>
&nbsp;and control? about that ambivalent psychological state where the
<br>
&nbsp;public mind hovers between total fascination with terror and total
<br>
&nbsp;willingness to be disciplined in the name of personal security. What
<br>
&nbsp;does electronic art have to say about the pleasure of discipline in
<br>
&nbsp;the simulacrum?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It turns out a lot. Sometimes prophecies of the future appear in the
<br>
&nbsp;most unlikely spaces. Such as at *Usine C*, a hyperreal art
<br>
&nbsp;performance space, during the electronic art events of ~Elektra~.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;For a week, ~Elektra~ has jammed together the artistic energies of
<br>
&nbsp;digital performers with the spectacle-hungry energy of the Montreal
<br>
&nbsp;streets. Politics and art and fashion and the recent history of
<br>
&nbsp;technology in ruins and disciplinary politics on the rise have now
<br>
&nbsp;had a week to catch the scent of something big happening from their
<br>
&nbsp;usually particularized positions in the universe of life. This
<br>
&nbsp;Saturday evening, in this split city on the northern boundary of the
<br>
&nbsp;split empire of America, the major threads of contemporary political
<br>
&nbsp;history have chosen to make their first appearance by way of the
<br>
&nbsp;world premiere of Louis-Philippe Demers' ~L'Assemblee~.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The art rhetoric is perfectly staged in advance:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;~L'Assemblee~ is the world premiere of Louis-Philippe Demers' last
<br>
&nbsp;robotic installation. ~L'Assemblee~ stages a group of machines, 48
<br>
&nbsp;identical robotic members surrounding a metallic arena. This
<br>
&nbsp;performance proposes an intense visual and aural experience.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;What the art description doesn't say, maybe what it cannot say in
<br>
&nbsp;advance since ~L'Assemblee~ has the enigmatic quality of being purely
<br>
&nbsp;experiential art, unpredictable in advance, is that the &quot;48 identical
<br>
&nbsp;robots surrounding a metallic arena&quot; have also been worrying a lot
<br>
&nbsp;about the political situation, and they are prepared to spill the
<br>
&nbsp;essential political secret of future days: AS SOON AS WE ARE CLOSE TO
<br>
&nbsp;POWER, WE WORSHIP POWER.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;For these robots, the seduction of power relies on the simultaneous
<br>
&nbsp;proximity and alienation of the worshipping crowd. The crowd is
<br>
&nbsp;silent: not allowed to speak, only to listen. This is the world
<br>
&nbsp;premiere of 48 robotic political theorists taking us into the codes
<br>
&nbsp;of the future from deep within the specular logic of machine and
<br>
&nbsp;music. In ~L'Assemblee~ the body is the lighted star at the spectacle
<br>
&nbsp;of its own disappearance. The adoration of surveillance, then, as the
<br>
&nbsp;technological future. 48 robotic political theorists can't be wrong.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Robots as New Media Stars
<br>
&nbsp;-------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;<a href="http://www.c3.hu/events/98/baginsky/workshop/robart.html">http://www.c3.hu/events/98/baginsky/workshop/robart.html</a>
<br>
&nbsp;The theatrical setting for the performance of 48 robots is ideal.
<br>
&nbsp;*~AI~ cut with ~Road Warriors~ to produce a ~Blade Runner~ version of
<br>
&nbsp;a ~Blue Velvet~ moment*. The robots are mounted on a large-scale
<br>
&nbsp;metallic scaffolding. An architectural membrane for robots. The
<br>
&nbsp;visual effect is intensely cinematic. Each robot machine is
<br>
&nbsp;simultaneously a light source, a motion vehicle, a site of sound
<br>
&nbsp;performance, a witness of the gathering spectators below and a cosmic
<br>
&nbsp;entry-point to the digital blast above. Pneumatically controlled, the
<br>
&nbsp;robot lights are individually programmed, capable of finely machined,
<br>
&nbsp;beautifully nuanced movement in tune to the surrounding dromoscopic
<br>
&nbsp;sounds: light waves sweeping across the crowd of faces, arching
<br>
&nbsp;upwards in ~Triumph of the Will~ light sculptural motifs-sometimes
<br>
&nbsp;released from the codes to move at the pace of individualized robotic
<br>
&nbsp;whimsy; sometimes aggressively grouped together like a robotic
<br>
&nbsp;performance of Ayn Rand's ~Atlas Shrugged~. Robots as new media
<br>
&nbsp;stars.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;For spectators, there is a certain degree of freedom. Why not? In
<br>
&nbsp;~L'Assemblee~ humans are simultaneously essential plug-ins to complete
<br>
&nbsp;the artistic circuitry of the 48 robots in a metallic arena, and
<br>
&nbsp;completely peripheral to a robotic performance which functions
<br>
&nbsp;automatically. To the question: What to do in the simulacrum?
<br>
&nbsp;~L'Assemblee~ answers simply: it doesn't really matter. Extreme
<br>
&nbsp;technology in the form of robots running on automatic software codes
<br>
&nbsp;are the essential locus of power, animated equally by answering
<br>
&nbsp;responses of adoration or indifference. ~L'Assemblee~ is the first
<br>
&nbsp;artistic sign of the epoch of the post-human, with an existential
<br>
&nbsp;robot philosophy of tech adoration cut with hyper-boredom.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It's never easy to be peripheral to the (technological) action, to be
<br>
&nbsp;refused an easy confirming assent to persisting dreams of imprinting
<br>
&nbsp;(human) biology on technology, but if that's the way it is, then with
<br>
&nbsp;~L'Assemblee~ you take your pre-programmed, pre-configured, pre-coded
<br>
&nbsp;subject-position. You can choose to be a ~robo-lurker~, sitting on
<br>
&nbsp;the dark edge of the concrete floor, smoking and looking and thinking
<br>
&nbsp;and feeling the pulsating sound wave-forms and moving light arrays of
<br>
&nbsp;the 48 robots. A spectacle of immense seduction in a metallic arena.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Or moving physically into the epicenter of ~L'Assemblee~-your body as
<br>
&nbsp;part of the crowd triangulated by 48 robots, strobe lights, and
<br>
&nbsp;cameras-you can choose deep immersion in the emotional experience of
<br>
&nbsp;~L'Assemblee~. It's the preferred position of many: part adoration of
<br>
&nbsp;the choir of 48 robots above; part narcissism of being the
<br>
&nbsp;light-object of technological desire.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Life in the interval between adoration and abandonment. This is an
<br>
&nbsp;art of experience, not an art of observation. Its outsourcing of the
<br>
&nbsp;future can only be activated by human spectators. Perhaps that is why
<br>
&nbsp;as you sway with the crowd, caught up in a strange trance-like mood
<br>
&nbsp;of seduction of the image/sound/light machine, you can actually
<br>
&nbsp;~feel~ the ocular regime of the eye of surveillance. All those light
<br>
&nbsp;arrays, all that drone sound, all those blurred images, all that
<br>
&nbsp;hypnotic movement as the orchestra of robots moves from a single
<br>
&nbsp;light and a single sound that registers the beginning of the
<br>
&nbsp;simulacrum to immensely complicated, immensely beautiful wave-forms
<br>
&nbsp;of light and sound and images that hook their way directly to the
<br>
&nbsp;pleasure receptors of the nervous system. Participants in the
<br>
&nbsp;interval of the simulacrum are simultaneously humiliated (you are
<br>
&nbsp;forced to look upwards at the robotic light array) and transformed
<br>
&nbsp;into instant stars for one new media moment (robot lights constantly
<br>
&nbsp;sweep over the crowd, displaying the captured faces on video
<br>
&nbsp;screens).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It turns out that robots are skilled in the language of seduction and
<br>
&nbsp;the games of artifice. Fascination is the only rule, with a gradient
<br>
&nbsp;of aesthetic pleasure running from the exterior of the performance to
<br>
&nbsp;its interior, from people as spectators on the outside of the
<br>
&nbsp;metallic arena to the body of the crowd tranced on the concrete
<br>
&nbsp;floor, transfixed by the beat and lights of the 48 robotic
<br>
&nbsp;machine-performers. Total sensory involvement through total bodily
<br>
&nbsp;desensitization.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;As suddenly as ~L'Assemblee~ began, it abruptly ends. Robot lights go
<br>
&nbsp;dark. Sound vanishes. The surrounding networks of screens go blue,
<br>
&nbsp;then black. Bodies have their trance-plugs pulled. Everybody falls
<br>
&nbsp;back into the loneliness of the digital crowd. Crescendo followed by
<br>
&nbsp;blankness: the code of the new body. So, you are left standing there
<br>
&nbsp;on an empty performance floor thinking what is the relationship
<br>
&nbsp;between large-scale robotic performance and the relentless movement
<br>
&nbsp;of contemporary technology towards the invisibility of genetic
<br>
&nbsp;engineering, nano-technology, machine-to-machine communication via
<br>
&nbsp;spyware. Is this nostalgia or futurism? And of course it is both:
<br>
&nbsp;nostalgia because ~L'Assemble~ is a resurrection-effect of ancient
<br>
&nbsp;collective rituals-adoration, congregation, transcendence, shared
<br>
&nbsp;ritualistic experience that always marks the entry of the sacred; and
<br>
&nbsp;futurism because ~L'Assemble~ indicates that the space of the
<br>
&nbsp;(technological) sacred is running on full automatic, with the
<br>
&nbsp;worshipping (electronic) crowd as alternating currents of adoration
<br>
&nbsp;and indifference. Future nostalgia as the opening code of the 21st
<br>
&nbsp;century.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Post-performance, we're talking to David Therrien, a nomad artist
<br>
&nbsp;from Phoenix, Arizona who was there to see the show and maybe to lend
<br>
&nbsp;a body jolt of solar energy to the performance. Therrien is one of
<br>
&nbsp;those larger than life performance artists of the American scene:
<br>
&nbsp;probing at the edge of robotic technology, restless to look beyond
<br>
&nbsp;the horizon, experimenting with new communication technologies to
<br>
&nbsp;reverse-engineer globalization. With a wireless imagination that's
<br>
&nbsp;truly global and a performance body as a suicide machine,  he tells
<br>
&nbsp;us that he has just started a new performance space in Phoenix. In
<br>
&nbsp;the 90s it was called the *Icehouse*. Now it's a factory space for
<br>
&nbsp;large-scale machinic performance called *Automatic*. Why *Automatic*?
<br>
&nbsp;Because for Therrien, &quot;comfort and control&quot; is the real direction of
<br>
&nbsp;technology. As he says: &quot;What's really seductive is the perfection of
<br>
&nbsp;technology. People really want to leave their imperfect bodies. They
<br>
&nbsp;want to imprint biology onto technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In ~L'Assemblee~, if we can't exit the body, then at least for one
<br>
&nbsp;performance, for one ~Elecktra~ moment, perhaps we want to be in the
<br>
&nbsp;presence of the *automatic*, surrounded by the aura of technological
<br>
&nbsp;perfection, the comforting presence of Demers' seductive vision of 48
<br>
&nbsp;robots engaged in a highly structured ritual of total control. That
<br>
&nbsp;this hope for technological perfection is probably unattainable makes
<br>
&nbsp;~L'Assemblee's~ robotic performance all the more seductive.
<br>
&nbsp;~L'Assemblee~ is a dream of impossible transcendence in a troubled
<br>
&nbsp;time. Its visual topology is about crowds and surveillance. However,
<br>
&nbsp;its aesthetic topology is about something else: the new order of the
<br>
&nbsp;*technological sublime* as the common dream of all the assembled
<br>
&nbsp;robots.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Disassembled Robots

<br>
&nbsp;With this significant political difference. Like a strange mutation,
<br>
&nbsp;the aesthetic model of ~L'Assemblee~ has no sooner been performed
<br>
&nbsp;than it slips the traces of *Usine C*, entering the political arena
<br>
&nbsp;as the new order of power in the &quot;war against terrorism.&quot; Now the
<br>
&nbsp;*political* robots assemble, each with its scripted lines: Bush
<br>
&nbsp;spotlights an audience of Muslims with this aphorism: &quot;Evil has no
<br>
&nbsp;holy day.&quot; Rumsfeld was last seen throwing money out of air force
<br>
&nbsp;helicopters, rapping all the while &quot;It's just a matter of economics.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;Those special-ops forces are still on their tired horses, deep in
<br>
&nbsp;bandit country. &quot;The noose is tightening. Wanted: Dead or Alive.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The script goes on.

<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>Ever wondered what goes into the process of building a robot from scratch?
<br>
Follow a team of engineers from NYC-based Honeybee Robotics as, 10,000
<br>
engineering hours over deadline, they work to finish W.I.S.O.R. (Welding and
<br>
Steam Operations Robot), a 7ft. long, 800 lb semi-autonomous robo-welder
<br>
created exclusively to mend Manhattan's 100-year-old, 100+ mile long steampipe
<br>
system. More information about the acclaimed documentary, directed by
<br>
Negroponte, can be found here.
<br>
<a href="http://www.wisor.net/">http://www.wisor.net/</a>
<br>
<p>Hidden beneath many major cities, an aging network of pipes carries steam heat
<br>
to large buildings. When pipes leak, workers dig up the roadway, causing
<br>
traffic snarls. But soon WISOR, invented by Honeybee Robotics of New York, may
<br>
be able to help. The 8-foot-long, 700-pound robot moves through pipes somewhat
<br>
like an inchworm. A remote operator uses cameras to align the machine with a
<br>
leaking flange seam in the pipe. Once WISOR is in place, a tool in the front
<br>
prepares the joint for repair by milling a groove around the seam. The whole
<br>
machine scoots forward, moving its rear welding tool into position, and a
<br>
rubber bladder in the middle expands to block the flow of leaking steam. Then
<br>
the robot fixes the joint by arc-welding the flange shut— all at ambient
<br>
temperatures of up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. WISOR has passed its endurance
<br>
tests, and the Con Edison power company hopes to start using it in New York
<br>
later this year.
