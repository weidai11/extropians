Review by Maria Trochatos on Nov 19th 2001
<br>
<p>Evolutionary Origins of Morality: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives (EOM),
<br>
edited by Leonard Katz, contains a collection of papers originally published
<br>
in the Journal of Consciousness Studies (vol. 7, no. 1-2, 2000). EOM is
<br>
divided into four sections, each taking a different approach to explaining the
<br>
possible contribution of evolution to our understanding of human moral
<br>
behaviour -- primate ethology, anthropology, evolutionary biology, and game
<br>
theory (dynamic systems modelling). Each section includes a target article, a
<br>
number of commentaries on the paper, and the author's reply to these
<br>
commentaries.
<br>
<p>In soliciting papers for this volume, Katz did not specify a firm definition
<br>
of 'morality', and this is clear from the distinct approaches to the concept
<br>
of morality adopted by each author. For example, for Brian Skyrms, it is the
<br>
idea of fairness; for Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson, it is
<br>
psychological altruism; for Christopher Boehm it is the social management of
<br>
conflict. Perhaps Jessica Flack's and Frans de Waal's paper comes closest to
<br>
our everyday understanding of moral behaviour - the basic idea of having
<br>
concern for others.
<br>
<p>This collection is a welcome addition to the literature on morality, since it
<br>
offers a perspective that differs considerably from our commonsense intuitions
<br>
about the nature of morality. We all (I hope) have intuitions about what is
<br>
good and bad, and about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts. But we do
<br>
not often consider what underlies or gives rise to these intuitions. EOM
<br>
offers an evolutionary response to this question. However, many believe that
<br>
Darwinian evolution, with its catch-cry of 'survival of the fittest', is a
<br>
poor basis for a moral system, since it suggests that our primary concern is
<br>
to advance our own interests and needs at the expense of others. In contrast,
<br>
the papers in EOM demonstrate how evolution is implicated in the
<br>
establishment, development and maintenance of moral systems.
<br>
<p>Since there are too many papers to comment on individually in such a short
<br>
review, I shall focus on the first two, and comment only briefly on the latter
<br>
two. Jessica Flack's and Frans de Waal's target paper, 'Any Animal Whatever:
<br>
Darwinian Building Blocks of Morality in Monkeys and Apes', addresses the
<br>
relationships and continuities between primate and human moral behaviour.
<br>
Flack and de Waal provide evidence for what they believe is proto-moral
<br>
behaviour in the social interactions of both monkeys and apes, our closest
<br>
evolutionary 'relatives'. These behaviours, they suggest, are 'building
<br>
blocks' for the evolution of human morality. Underlying these behaviours are a
<br>
number of psychological traits, sentiments and capacities that primates seem
<br>
to share with humans. Flack and de Waal describe four broad categories of
<br>
behaviour that are significant to primate 'moral' systems (p. 22). Firstly,
<br>
there is sympathy related behaviour, such as succourance, emotional contagion,
<br>
special treatment of the disabled and injured, and cognitive empathy (the
<br>
ability to 'trade places' with others). Secondly, there is norm related
<br>
behaviour. This includes evidence of prescriptive social rules, the
<br>
internalisation of these rules and the anticipation of punishment, a sense of
<br>
social regularity, and expectations about how one ought to be treated.
<br>
Reciprocity is central to primate groups, involving the concepts of giving,
<br>
trading and revenge, as well as moralistic aggression against violators of
<br>
reciprocity rules. Lastly, primates demonstrate 'getting along' behaviours,
<br>
such as peacemaking and the avoidance of conflict, community concern and
<br>
maintenance of good relationships, and negotiation to accommodate conflicting
<br>
interests. Notice that, in one form or another, these behaviours are also
<br>
manifest in human moral and social systems (especially empathy, the
<br>
internalisation of rules, a sense of justice, and community concern).
<br>
<p>The commentaries on this paper vary in their focus. For example, Bernstein (p.
<br>
31) discusses the difficulty of identifying the motivations underlying primate
<br>
behaviour. How does one provide sound evidence of the traits, sentiments and
<br>
capacities that Flack and de Waal note? Call (p. 34) highlights the difference
<br>
between the use and the perception of social norms. Humans use and perceive
<br>
social norms, but it is not clear that primates do. Gruter and Morhenn (p. 38)
<br>
claim that the social norms regulating primate behaviour parallel norms found
<br>
in human legal systems (e.g. compare conflict resolution mechanisms in
<br>
primates, and dispute resolution in law). Kagan (p. 46) claims that primates
<br>
lack essential elements of moral competence -- the concepts of good, bad,
<br>
guilt; or acting from conscious intention -- that humans possess.
<br>
<p>For me, this is the most interesting and revealing of all the papers. The
<br>
evidence provided is compelling, suggesting that the difference between human
<br>
moral systems and primate 'moral' systems is not one of kind, but of degree
<br>
(or complexity, reflecting the complexity of social/living arrangements,
<br>
perhaps). A common intuition associated with morality is a sense of
<br>
universality or objectivity - acts are either just good or bad simpliciter.
<br>
But philosophers have yet to definitively identify the property (or process,
<br>
quality, substance, object, deity.) that grounds such judgements. However, the
<br>
evolutionary approach may actually provide a basis for this sense of
<br>
universality, and how better to demonstrate it than to show that the basic
<br>
elements of moral behaviour are not only found in humans, but also in our
<br>
non-human relatives? Yes, humans may be highly rational animals, but this does
<br>
not mean that there aren't elements of human morality that are shared with
<br>
other creatures. As Flack and de Waal comment, 'while there is no denying that
<br>
we are creatures of intellect, it is also clear that we are born with powerful
<br>
inclinations and emotions that bias our thinking and behavior. It is in this
<br>
area that many of the continuities with other animals lie' (p. 23).
<br>
<p>Anthropologist Christopher Boehm's paper 'Conflict and the Evolution of Social
<br>
Control' addresses the question 'How, When and Why Did the Unique Aspects of
<br>
Human Morality Arise?' He believes that the early identification and
<br>
collective suppression of within-group conflict (resulting from 'deviance'
<br>
against social norms) may provide a basis for the emergence of human moral
<br>
systems. Thus, his paper focuses on within-group conflict and the social
<br>
control of that conflict. Moral systems are driven by considerations of power
<br>
(both of deviants to hurt others, and of the social collective to eliminate
<br>
deviant behaviour), as well as the 'common agreement as to which behaviours
<br>
are unacceptable.it also involves a group's overall conception of a
<br>
satisfactory quality of social and political life' (p. 80).
<br>
<p>Boehm's evidence is based on data from studies of the two Pan species
<br>
(chimpanzees and bonobos) and Homo (anatomically modern humans). Boehm assumes
<br>
that features shared by all three species are 'likely to have been present in
<br>
the ancestor shared by Homo and Pan, who lived five million years ago.' (p.
<br>
81). Common behaviours include a foraging lifestyle, territoriality, community
<br>
living, proneness to status rivalry and competition, and the forming of
<br>
political coalitions. These features all lead to conflict, thus all three
<br>
species need to (and do) engage in deliberate conflict resolution and
<br>
management of deviant behaviour. Conflict, then, becomes a stimulus for moral
<br>
behaviour. Social control mechanisms, Boehm claims, are found in modern-day
<br>
nomadic, foraging or hunter-gatherer groups, who are also uniform in their
<br>
social, moral and political structure. They uphold values by applying
<br>
sanctions to deviants, and they are uniformly egalitarian by suppressing undue
<br>
competition and pre-empting domination or controlling behaviour by
<br>
individuals.
<br>
<p>In effect, Boehm is providing a hypothesis about how social contracts emerge.
<br>
His approach is reminiscent of Thomas Hobbes' account of morality based on the
<br>
social contract. According to Hobbes, morality is a solution to a practical
<br>
problem arising from human self-interest - morality incorporates those rules
<br>
that individuals must abide by in order to gain the benefits of living in a
<br>
social collective. Humans are primarily self-interested. However, if
<br>
individuals are completely egoistic or selfish, there would be no community,
<br>
only a 'state of nature' (individuals compete for the resources to satisfy
<br>
their own needs, and cannot rely on the help of others). However, under the
<br>
social contract, everyone agrees to abide by moral rules and to co-operate.
<br>
The rules are also enforced by the state, to minimise cheating. Group members
<br>
occasionally forego their individual needs but, overall, they (and everyone)
<br>
will benefit by being a co-operating member of the social group.
<br>
<p>This sounds like a plausible theory. Boehm seems to provide anthropological,
<br>
historical and other evidence for how such a social contract may have arisen.
<br>
But there is a problem with his hypothesis - it is not empirically testable
<br>
(this point is highlighted by Bernstein, p. 105). Boehm's paper reads like a
<br>
'just-so' story, based on what appears to be quite diverse (and sometimes
<br>
quite weak) evidence. Both Hobbes and Boehm offer descriptions of the
<br>
circumstances that seem to be logically required for a moral community to
<br>
arise, but it does not follow that this is what actually occurred. It would be
<br>
difficult to devise a method of demonstrating Boehm's hypothesis, especially
<br>
since much of that evidence is out of reach, in human pre-history and in the
<br>
'minds' of non-human creatures. Dentan (p. 123) also agrees that Boehm's
<br>
metaphysical speculations are not either scientifically testable or
<br>
falsifiable.
<br>
<p>But Boehm's interpretation and presentation of the evidence is also
<br>
problematic. Black (p. 107) cites counter-evidence to Boehm's view that the
<br>
group as a collective suppresses the deviant behaviour of individuals:
<br>
hunter-gather societies rarely handle conflict in a law-like way, and society
<br>
as a whole is rarely the agent of social control. In fact, there is
<br>
considerable variability between social groups in how offences are defined and
<br>
dealt with depending, for example, on the social distance and level of
<br>
inequality between the relevant parties - and this applies to both humans and
<br>
non-humans (p. 108). Gardner (p. 128) notes that mobile, egalitarian foraging
<br>
groups may not be representative of our past. Thierry (p. 144) claims that in
<br>
the simple hunter-gatherer societies on which Boehm focuses, there are more
<br>
prohibited behaviours than those relating to domination behaviour. Knauft (p.
<br>
130) criticises the implicitly patriarchal nature of Boehm's hypothesis,
<br>
claiming that the role of females needs greater emphasis (Flack and de Waal's
<br>
paper, for example, provides evidence regarding the role of female chimpanzees
<br>
in facilitating conflict-resolutions).
<br>
<p>The evolutionary biology perspective is presented in the third section, 'Are
<br>
We Really Altruists?' Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson provide a summary
<br>
of their 1998 book Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish
<br>
Behavior. Their project is a descriptive one - to determine whether
<br>
evolutionary altruism exists in nature, and whether our motives involve an
<br>
irreducible concern for the welfare of others. While evolutionary altruism is
<br>
defined as behaviour that involves a fitness cost to the donor, and fitness
<br>
benefits to the recipient (e.g. reproductive success), psychological altruism
<br>
concerns the underlying motives for behaviour. Sober and Wilson suggest that
<br>
the evolution of psychological altruism is facilitated by the mechanism of
<br>
group selection. They suggest that group selection is a conceptually coherent
<br>
concept, that it is empirically well-documented, and that it is particularly
<br>
relevant to human evolution. 'We propose an evolutionary argument for the
<br>
claim that human beings have altruistic ultimate motives' (p. 185).
<br>
<p>The final paper by Brian Skyrms, 'Game Theory, Rationality and Evolution of
<br>
the Social Contract' is a response to the question 'Can Fairness Evolve?' Game
<br>
theory provides a mathematical or symbolic representation of the rational
<br>
strategies of a number of individuals in game-like human interactions. In this
<br>
paper, Skyrms compares two types of game theory - the classic version, based
<br>
on rational choice, and an alternative based on evolutionary or adaptive
<br>
dynamics. He illustrates the differences by discussing a number of 'games'
<br>
that model interactions common to any 'social contract'.
<br>
<p>These last two papers are both difficult - particularly for the reader (like
<br>
myself) not overly familiar with the subject-matter. The use of probabilistic
<br>
formulae may also deter some readers uncomfortable with this methodology. For
<br>
example, from Sober and Wilson, the table below sets out the fitness payoffs
<br>
for altruistic and selfish individuals when they interact (group size: two).
<br>
The formulae determine the fitness of the two traits, Altruism and Selfishness
<br>
(p. 189-190):
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other player is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A S
<br>
Fitness of a A x + b - c x - c
<br>
player who is S x + b x
<br>
<p><p>w(A) = p(x+b+c) + (1-p)(x-c) = pb + x - c
<br>
<p>w(S) = (q)(x+b) + (1-q)(x) = qb + x
<br>
<p>Or, from Skyrms: 'U(A|B)' represents the playoff of strategy A when played
<br>
against strategy B. Thus, the 'expected Fitness for a strategy is an average
<br>
of its payoffs against alternative strategies weighted by the population
<br>
proportions of other strategies' (p. 273):
<br>
<p>U(A) = SUMi U(A|Bi) P(Bi)
<br>
<p>This symbolic notation is not explained clearly enough for the non-expert to
<br>
follow. This is disappointing, since the material presented not only provides
<br>
an insightful perspective on, but is clearly relevant to, our understanding of
<br>
the basic 'calculus' of moral behaviour. But we must allow for the fact that
<br>
these are concisely written journal articles, which typically focus very
<br>
closely on their subject-matter, and allow little room for scene-setting.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, as I said earlier, this volume is a welcome addition to the
<br>
literature on morality. The mainly descriptive approach taken by the principal
<br>
authors and their commentators provides a number of alternative answers
<br>
concerning the influences or motivations underlying human moral behaviour. And
<br>
for those still wary of Darwinian evolution, note that morality can still be a
<br>
result of evolutionary processes, without being directly selected itself. The
<br>
evolutionary approach still leaves room for the effects of social, cultural
<br>
and other dynamic processes, as these papers admirably demonstrate.
