Consolidated Reply to this thread
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; The &quot;federation&quot; simply consists of the communities that agree on the constitution. This constitution contains penalty clauses
<br>
and likely some mutual defense clauses against outside threats. If a community violates the constitution, it has to pay the penalty.
<br>
If it refuses, then it clearly isn't part of the federation. In addition to clauses guaranteeing free emigration, it doesn't seem
<br>
unreasonable to include clauses about free
<br>
travel or even inspection from the other communities. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, this explains the core concepts rather well. Perhaps I should emphasize again that we should not fall into the &quot;one size fits
<br>
all&quot; thinking when thinking about such important but complex phenomena known as societies.
<br>
<p>I think some kind of inspections will definitely come into play, but perhaps visits of convoys from other communities recuiting new
<br>
members may have more effectiveness. For instance, one can run some kind of neutral armed shuttle service to visit each community
<br>
and shuttle potential applicants to and fro between colonies. let us not try to judge for others, but let them judge for themselves
<br>
if they can leave freely. Bear in mind that this only consists of one idea that may work.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Being thrown out would likely be a fairly serious punishment, which unlike penalties cannot be avoided. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, this would consist of the most serious penalty under the treaty. Of course, if the person in question breaks the treaty (such
<br>
as by forcefully returning despite the ban), then harser punishments can lie in wait. I consider this a better trade-off, than say,
<br>
the death penalty or life imprisonment.
<br>
<p>I consider life imprisonment as worse than death, by confining one to a non-meaningful existance in an enviromnent controlled by
<br>
others.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Whether the consitution would be about sentient rights or human rights is of course important in the long run, but setting up a
<br>
system somewhat like the above federation is something we can do in the near future. This system can then adapt to new developments,
<br>
and if the constitution update process is not unnecessarily rigid it wouldn't be too hard to include general sentient rights as
<br>
people become more aware of their possibility. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think that the treaty would have as little clauses as possible. While it seems good to add such additional safeguards, we should
<br>
err on the side of saying too little instead of saying too much and converting the flexible treaty into inflexible red tape.
<br>
<p>In programming, such things like adding fancy features have caused often more harm than good, like Microsoft's drawing &quot;legs on
<br>
snakes&quot; (to quote a Chinese idiom) by adding such irritating things like &quot;Personalized Menus&quot;.  Likewise, we should take great care
<br>
to avoid this problem when we draft such a treaty. The future communities may hate us for this if we don't. :)
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; The important thing to remember about systems like this is that we do not have to get everything perfectly right at the first
<br>
try. Good political solutions are flexible and can be adaptive. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well said. It would perhaps not deviate too far to say that they should get the most useful work done with the least amount of
<br>
words.
<br>
<p>While existanistial risks may cast doubts, we can probably add the consideration and prevention of such risks into the above
<br>
definition. Having people set up communities in outer space greatly reduces the chance of such preventable risks.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; IMO, the right of transit and hospitality are missing. You would need this to go from community A through B to C, where A may be
<br>
a green-socialist community and B klingon-warriors. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The (loose) federation proposal, in its simplest terms, does not address this directly. I presume that the actual federation
<br>
implemention will also place some kind of rules to cover this, such as by requiring every community to provide an isolated facility
<br>
(much like a hotel) for travellers. This could also take in incoming refuges without compromising the internal security of the
<br>
community.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Will community A survive when B decides they need more space? Who could possibly hinder them? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The treaty should have a provision that the other communities cannot enter the terrorities of the colony first claimed (and proven
<br>
by patrols) without permission. This means that the other community will consider any entry as invasion. An invasion would mean
<br>
interfering in another terrority's affairs and thus the breaking of the treaty.
<br>
<p>In space, thanks to the observation of Charles Champion who commented on this a few months or a year ago, we would have problems
<br>
delineating territory in space due to the difference between absolute and relative movement. If other people come to your land
<br>
without permission, then they invade you. If your land moves to their feet, then who invades whom?
<br>
<p>Unless we can use antigravity to stop all movement in the solar system to obtain a fixed frame of reference, we would find this
<br>
troubling (especially when people of different orbital extents) have orbital claims that move into your claimed territory.
<br>
<p>Considering this from the viewpoint of an interstellar civilisation, the problem would only worsen (though it would take a longer
<br>
time for terrority to conflict). We better start figuring out how to solve this problem, or how to *transcend* it by figuring a more
<br>
elegant method than the static, two dimensional maps of the world we have in our minds.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Most of us already live in such a system. Pluralistic societies consist of many different subcultures. They only share the same
<br>
room, but one can easily live in only one world without seeing much of the others. On a higher level, the Charta of the United
<br>
Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and several other international conventions go exactly in your direction.
<br>
Unfortunately, both plans only work when everyone observes the rules... &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I tend to disagree with this because apparently the United States has a habit of interfering on other nation's affairs for the
<br>
purpose of &quot;National Security&quot;.
<br>
<p>In addition, important differences lies with the Federation Proposal and our current system:
<br>
<p>1) Countries can still retain people within themselves against their will, such as to jail or kill them.
<br>
<p>For instance, in Singapore I cannot become a citizen of another nation or leave without permission unless I serve my military draft.
<br>
No matter whether you can justify if I should serve or not, under the federation, if I do not like to do so and I choose to leave, I
<br>
should have no obstacles in my way.
<br>
<p>Refer to: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Personal_Discourses/message/53">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Personal_Discourses/message/53</a>
<br>
<p><p>2) Countries today do not have enough &quot;ideological competitiveness&quot;.
<br>
<p>They still remain stuck in the old ways and don't give others real choices. Governments around the world still seem to subscribe to
<br>
red tape, older political systems (such as monarchy, oligopoly, democracy) and conservative thinking (to the detriment of extropians
<br>
of course).
<br>
<p>They don't seem to have any purpose other than some very vaguely defined &quot;politically correct&quot; items or just some items that do not
<br>
satisfy to population as to whether the nation actually wants to achieve such. Often in many parts of the world, it seems that the
<br>
government officers have more concern to their salary and pension than to their citizen's affairs or whether they help to fulfill
<br>
the goals of their nation.
<br>
<p><p>3) The UN seems far from non-interventionist. Even if the UN does not intervene, some other forces (like NATO) may do so.
<br>
<p>Imagine some not too politically powerful nation proclaiming that they will embark on a dedictated research project on, of all
<br>
things, human cloning. Imagine that they sound serious enough to promise results by 2005. Despite promises of ethical research, I
<br>
think the other nations will not just sit still and watch. &quot;Ban human cloning! Its immoral and goes against God!&quot;
<br>
<p>If they can make such fuss about mere human cloning, what would they think about the creation of an AI Singularity (especially when
<br>
AI in one to two decades get serious enough)? You might think faster than all the humans in the world, but when it comes to the
<br>
power plug in an isolated lab (i.e. no Internet or network to hack), you have a great disadvantage. Of course, they could also shut
<br>
down the power grid or station if they feel desperate enough.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>'2) They can restrict the people they take'
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; what if none will take you, or the only one to take you is undesirable? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That could cause some problems (especially if you had murdered a group of other people in cold blood), but genrally the Federation
<br>
proposal does not aim to solve this directly. It only aims to provide a framework of choice and non-intervention, protecting both
<br>
the weak and the powerful communities.
<br>
<p>You might not know if one day, someone sets up a &quot;Muderer's Colony&quot;.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; Compare this to my earlier discussions of having a minimalist universal ethics in a society to guarantee rights, with the ethics
<br>
of individual put on top of this; in this case the inter-community constitution would be similar to the minimalist ethics and mainly
<br>
deal with guaranteeing the rights of people and communities, but not prescribing their internal structure - that is left to their
<br>
internal rules. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I see a major problem here with this thinking.
<br>
<p>What if there exists a better way to solve our social problems than using &quot;rights&quot;, or at least, a better implementation and
<br>
definition of &quot;rights&quot;? If you base your treaty on such concepts, it might actually restrict other's freedom even if you seek to
<br>
guarantee freedom. Gödel's Theorem does not let you off so easily here.
<br>
<p>In my opinion, we can define a better guide to decision making than &quot;rights&quot; due to the highly flawed nature of &quot;rights&quot;. The only
<br>
&quot;rights&quot; I might grant consist of the right of non-intervention (but not to life, liberty and others &quot;God granted&quot; or inherent
<br>
rights), but even this has serious flaws defined in this context. A new vocabulary and way of thinking has to arise to explain this
<br>
clearly.
<br>
<p>As such, the treaty should not aim to cover all bases with &quot;rights&quot; but more with some sensible systems-based rules that also happen
<br>
to discourage the problems associated with lack of &quot;rights&quot;. For instance, the core rule that others can leave freely will prevent
<br>
supression of freedom (as most people define it).
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; There isn't any need to try this across the entire world at once, but it can be started on a relatively small scale and then
<br>
develop (both by more communities/nations joining, and possibly by the creation of smaller sub-communities if it appears promising
<br>
locally). &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think the current world situation does not seem encouraging in this aspect because many nations and people still feel unprepared
<br>
for it. For instance, one sometimes hears jokes on the political apathy in Singapore, and it seems like Singaporeans do not have
<br>
enough maturity to accept a full-fledged democracy (though many might disagree). Nations also seem very much attached to their
<br>
histories and current ways of life (read Israel vs. Palestine, China vs. Taiwan, India vs. Pakistan).
<br>
<p>I suspect that a great shock must occur to underline very clearly the problems of the current international political systems before
<br>
even a minority of the nations will consider this. Even so, if the largest, most powerful nations (who would lose the most with this
<br>
great shift in global political power) influenced the UN to outlaw or seriously deminish the power of the Federation (such as by not
<br>
allowing dual membership), this can cause a great set-back.
<br>
<p>The anti-Federational people can accuse the federation of many things to justify their policies, from encouging the stealing of
<br>
&quot;intellectual property&quot; to the lack of adequate &quot;human rights&quot;).
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; One difficulty though: where is evolution (personal and social) if one interacts only with people sharing the same ideology? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I think we would find it for the positive rather than the negative. If every nation in the world subscribes to this:
<br>
<p>Firstly, we would abolish &quot;ideology slavery&quot; where people force others to accept their ideology. To regain their freedom the unhappy
<br>
people must subscribe to the ideology. (If we consider capitalism this ideology, then I dare say it seems to apply).
<br>
<p><p>Secondly, it will abolish the petty struggles between the people of the world so that they can make peace with each other. China and
<br>
Taiwan need not fight over the Taiwanese land, neither does Israel and Pakistan fight with each other. The Cold War would not need
<br>
to happen.
<br>
<p>If you want to live a way of life, then you can do so as long as you don't interfere with others. China would not &quot;lose face&quot; if it
<br>
let Taiwan have independence, because they would offer two ideologies. If Stalin tried to starve poor peasants to death, someone can
<br>
go in and rescue them to another place that they can go. In fact, countries as we know it might crease to exist and solve the
<br>
problems of excessive government control of citizens once and for all.
<br>
<p>This will seem more practical when we can have low cost space travel and can colonize the huge emptiness of outer space.
<br>
<p><p>Thirdly, it would greatly amplifying the power of those who share the same ideology by bringing them together. These people can live
<br>
the way of life they like without conflicts with different fractions of different ideologies who argue over seemingly irrelevant
<br>
matters.
<br>
<p>We should recognise that while conflicts in theory sounds good, conflicts in reality do not fit such an assumption. In the real
<br>
world, people can exercise sabotage, deceit and other &quot;dirty tricks&quot; to get what they want.
<br>
<p><p>Lastly and very importantly, it would not diminish the ability of others to join different ideologies. One can always tour (if the
<br>
other community allows) other communities, read about them and even apply to join them. The original community cannot stop them (in
<br>
theory).
<br>
<p><p>The problem of Saddam peeing into the broth comes to mind, but for such people military action undertaken by some sympathetic
<br>
communities would do nicely. Those who live by the gun die by the gun, or so the saying goes. If Saddam likes war so much, then he
<br>
would get war then.
<br>
<p>Of course, I do remember Shakespeare's play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, in which a young child kids with his mother shortly before Macbeth's (the bad
<br>
guy) men arrived to slaughter the entire family that (in my words from my memories) 'the good man will not hang the bad men, because
<br>
there are more of them around. Instead, the bad men will hang the good man'. For this, sadly, I can offer no solutions yet.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; The cost in sentient suffering in a single non-federation community, under the framework you present, could enormously exceed the
<br>
sum of all sentient suffering in history up until this point.  This is not a trivial error. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Federation cannot, and does not seek to cover all bases (refer to Gödel's Theorem). When a community does not have any
<br>
outstanding treaties with another non-Federation member, it can send out its own humanitarian missions and even invade this member
<br>
to do what it feels right to. The same goes for these powers to invade Federation members.
<br>
<p>In short, this defaults to the old thinking of &quot;might is right&quot;. It has serious implications, because we can expect any nation that
<br>
wants to practice slavery (directly or indirectly) to strongly oppose this Federation. This could even cause the disassembling of
<br>
the Federation just as it began to start establishing itself if they have enough power to do so.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; No, but that is not something the federation was supposed to solve either. The fact that there is awful suffering and tyrrany in
<br>
some countries doesn't invalidate the political system of the US. The federation is not
<br>
based on an utilitarist ethical perspective where the goal is to maximize global happiness. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well, I consider this more of maximizing global choice. Whether the choice brings happiness or not, it remains for the individual to
<br>
choose to make it so. We should allow people to choose things that would go against happiness too, if we consider choice the
<br>
ultimate denominator of existence.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; I distrust the search for global optima and solutions that solve every problem. The world is complex, changing and filled with
<br>
adaptation, making any such absolutist solution futile, or worse, limiting. I prefer to view every proposed solution as partial and
<br>
under revision as we learn more. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I strongly agree with this. If only the Libertarians, Communists, and many others stop insisting that *only* they have the *only*
<br>
right solution...
<br>
<p>Just a thought: We might even consider the ideology of having no ideology as an ideology (but of course, that would make Gödel's
<br>
Theorem angry).
