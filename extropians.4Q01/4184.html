<em>&gt;Interesting. I really wonder what part of the primate cell

</em><br>
<em>&gt;knows?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Ya see, that is a fundamental difference between me and mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropianism: I say it's OK to go all Frankenstein with respect to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; genetic engineering--because GE deals with making biological bodies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and in order to be immortal, bodies are important...VERY important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe you have no plans of getting extropianism respected?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Calling something Frankenstein is not a statement about it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;merely being yuckky biology, but a statement that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unnecessary or unethical yuckky biology. Are you in favor of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unnecessary research (which takes resources that could be used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for real research) or unethical research (which is likely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produce a well armed opposition pursuing you)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>My American idioms may not go over all that well with you, it being a 2nd 
<br>
langauage for you. Actually, Dr F is a hero of mine.  My philosophy is that 
<br>
we are all dying anyway, so let it rip, etc...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There is a lot of yuckky ethical and nece
</em><br>
ssary research (like
<br>
<em>&gt;studies of cortical development, which requires some rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disturbing experiments on kittens), but that is a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;story. The ACT research belongs in this category IMHO, and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing to be squeamish about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Self-interest must prevail when it comes to animal experimentation--we have 
<br>
no social contract with them....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; OTOH, Extropianism says it's OK to go all Frankenstein with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to immigration.  Why is that, I ask? Oh, I see, because in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be immortal, we need cheaper busboys, dishwashers and house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; construction crews, etc. Uh huh...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is because you americans want bright people like ME &lt;loud
</em><br>
<em>&gt;European Mad Scientist laughter&gt; to immigrate and lecture at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your universities, enrich your culture or start transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;companies in a positive business climate.
</em><br>
<p>Do *scientific work is great...
<br>
<p><p>And yes, maybe work as
<br>
<em>&gt;dishwashers too.
</em><br>
<p>That's not OK, and neither is working as a programmer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The point is, immigration is good for the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the immigrants.
</em><br>
<p>Who cares if it is good for the immigrants; this outfit aint no charity.
<br>
Who cares if it is good the the USA, at least insofar as &quot;standard economic 
<br>
parameters&quot; are concerned.  In their day, the slave plantations did a great 
<br>
business---for the *owners*, that is...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just wait and see how the anti-immigrant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries of Europe will fare over the next decades with falling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;birth rates and more and more retired people.
</em><br>
<p>Who cares if birthrates fall? MOre natural resources left for those 
<br>
remaining. Of course, scientific research WOULD lag, and for immortalists 
<br>
like myself, taht would be bad.  But for non-immortalists, who cares if 
<br>
populations drop. That's good...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Face it, Extropianism is a memeset created by and for the GreedHeads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Commerce and the Empire Builders in Govt....actually, it is FOR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those who are farmed/ranched by the GreedHeads....
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I mispoke--Extropianism was definitely NOT created by 
<br>
GreedHeads/EmpireBuilders, but by wannabe  immortalists such as myself.  But 
<br>
parts of Extropainsim have been augmented and adopted by 
<br>
GreedHeads/EmpireBuilders, b/c it helps them out...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Interesting. The above is almost word by word a criticism I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heard of transhumanism over here too? One reason could be that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it is true of course, but there is another intriguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibility (not necessarily mutually exclusive): that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suffering from a certain memeset (what postmodernists call a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;narrative) that says extropianism must be due to some system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conspiracy to keep people down.
</em><br>
<p>Paranoia, huh? My philosophy was formed in part by many years of addiction 
<br>
to &quot;nature programs&quot; on TV and natural history and anthropolgy books and 
<br>
magazine articles. Nature red of tooth and claw, etc.  It applies in the 
<br>
domain of human affairs, as well. Is the gazelle paranoid when it bolts when 
<br>
a bounding rabbit rustles leaves?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;In fact, if you start to trace
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the associations of the above statement back (for example by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;looking at what texts and groups commonly use the same ideas and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms and who they in turn got them from) you will soon find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that there is indeed a rather coherent narrative that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;buying into here. Basically it says that free trade is always a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tool of oppression, and cannot be really good (in the long run,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least) for any individual except for the minority at the top.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So people promoting free trade and similar ideas such as free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;immigration either has to be dupes, belonging to the minority
</em><br>
<em>&gt;profiting from it or willingly bought by it. Interesting enough,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people beliving in this memeset almost never ask themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether *they* believe what they do because it profits them in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some way, or because they have assimilated these ideas from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surrounding culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;\
</em><br>
<p><p>There is no black and white....only shades of grey?
<br>
<p>My ideas are original; I am fairly sure of that. I fact, I used to be an 
<br>
ardent free trader, but as you grow older and read more, you learn....
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;I would say the empirical evidence is fairly good that free
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trade and free movement of people makes nations more wealthy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peaceful, making it a rational strategy to strive for such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;things. Others might disagree, but then we can discuss this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;using rational discourse rather than assuming the other has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;bought&quot; by special interests. Even if Max More was personally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hired by the Illuminati to spread extropianism, it might still
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be a good idea - either it holds together under scrutiny, or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>IN some respects, yes, More et al have been bought. They chase business 
<br>
speaking engagements, yes?
<br>
Extropianism as a philsophical foundation (read &quot;pretext&quot;) for Greedheads?
<br>
<p>Extropianists who seek these speaking engagements had best say what the 
<br>
GreedHeads want to hear...
<br>
<p>(Re: Greedheads: anyone who wants money, but doesn't admit to wanting to 
<br>
live forever--self serving, I know....)
