<p>Which civilisation?
<br>
<p>November 2001
<br>
<p>The idea of a liberal &quot;west,&quot; standing out against fundamentalism, is a
<br>
fallacy. In America, religious fundamentalism is more powerful than
<br>
secular
<br>
humanism. And the religious right and the romantic left in the west
<br>
share an
<br>
Arcadian, pre-modern vision similar to that of Muslim conservatives
<br>
<p>Michael Lind
<br>
<p><p>Since 11th september, political leaders have struggled to define the
<br>
sides
<br>
in what is clearly a kind of war. Is it a war between radical Muslims
<br>
and
<br>
the US? Is it a war between the Christian west and Islam? Or is the
<br>
conflict
<br>
an even larger one-between secularism and fundamentalism around the
<br>
world?
<br>
<p>The most influential attempts to define the post-cold war world have
<br>
been
<br>
those of Francis Fukuyama in The End of History and the Last Man (1992)
<br>
and
<br>
Samuel P Huntington, in his essay &quot;The Clash of Civilisations&quot; (1993).
<br>
Fukuyama famously argued that liberal democracy is the final stage of
<br>
human
<br>
political evolution. Huntington emphasises the persistence of pre-modern
<br>
linguistic, cultural and religious divisions, like those between western
<br>
and
<br>
eastern Christendom and Confucian and Hindu Asia.
<br>
<p>Each of these schemas captures aspects of reality. But an alternative
<br>
that
<br>
deserves consideration is one that defines &quot;civilisations&quot; in terms, not
<br>
of
<br>
technological development or culture, but of world view. This approach
<br>
gives
<br>
us fewer civilisations than those listed by Huntington-but more than the
<br>
single end-stage civilisation proposed by Fukuyama.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From this perspective, the most important civilisational divide-one that
</em><br>
seems even more important after the events of 11th September-may be the
<br>
one
<br>
between supernatural civilisations and secular civilisations. The divide
<br>
is
<br>
roughly, but not completely, correlated with the divide between
<br>
pre-modern
<br>
agrarian societies and industrial societies. Of the supernatural
<br>
civilisations, the most significant have been the Abrahamic (Judaism,
<br>
Christianity and Islam) and the Indic (Hinduism and Buddhism). The two
<br>
major
<br>
Abrahamic religions, Christianity and Islam, conquered most of the
<br>
world's
<br>
territory and people, including south Asia and the Americas. Only China
<br>
and
<br>
Japan, among the major non-western nations, escaped Muslim or Christian
<br>
rule. Today Muslim theocracies like Afghanistan, Iran, Sudan and Saudi
<br>
Arabia are the most extreme examples of societies based on supernatural
<br>
religion.
<br>
<p>On the secular side of the civilisational divide, there have been three
<br>
major traditions: humanism, rationalism and romanticism. These three
<br>
traditions originated in Europe but now have adherents around the world.
<br>
All
<br>
three are essentially secular worldviews which do not need to invoke the
<br>
authority of divine revelation or mystical gnosis (though some romantics
<br>
are
<br>
mystics or pantheists and some humanists have been religious believers).
<br>
In
<br>
respects other than their common secularism, the three traditions are
<br>
fundamentally different from one another.
<br>
<p>Humanist civilisation crystallised in Renaissance Italy, before
<br>
spreading to
<br>
the Netherlands, Britain, and the US. This liberal, commercial,
<br>
increasingly
<br>
democratic civilisation has spread to other nations by emulation
<br>
(Lafayette's France, AtatÜrk's Turkey, Yeltsin's Russia) and by conquest
<br>
and
<br>
conversion (post-1945 Germany and Japan). Humanists seek to ameliorate
<br>
the
<br>
problems of social life with the guidance of practical wisdom, derived
<br>
chiefly from history, literature and custom, with little or no reference
<br>
to
<br>
supernatural religion or natural science, with the possible exception of
<br>
the
<br>
emergent sociobiology. Humanists tend to be modest as philosophers and
<br>
cautious as reformers. Examples of great humanist thinkers and statesmen
<br>
are
<br>
Petrarch, Erasmus, Bacon, Montaigne, Voltaire, Franklin, Hume, Burke,
<br>
Smith,
<br>
Hamilton, Jefferson and Madison.
<br>
<p>Rationalism, a world view underlying a number of secular creeds, first
<br>
crystallised in 17th and 18th-century France. Rationalists reject the
<br>
humanist distinction between practical wisdom and natural science. The
<br>
goal
<br>
of rationalists of all kinds is to devise a science of society, modelled
<br>
on
<br>
natural science, which can serve as the basis for the construction of a
<br>
&quot;rational&quot; social order. Stephen Toulmin makes a useful distinction
<br>
between
<br>
the &quot;reasonableness&quot; of Renaissance humanists and the &quot;rationality&quot; of
<br>
Enlightenment philosophes. The rationalist pantheon includes social
<br>
engineers like Condorcet, St Simon, Comte, Fourier, Bentham, Marx, Lenin
<br>
and
<br>
Ayn Rand. (The &quot;secular humanists&quot; who support world federalism and
<br>
utopian
<br>
social reform are really rationalists).
<br>
<p>Romanticism, the third major secular world view, has spread widely from
<br>
its
<br>
original homeland, late 18th and early 19th-century Germany. Romantics
<br>
reject both reasonableness and rationality, they exalt the inspired
<br>
unreason
<br>
of the artistic genius, the child, the primitive uncorrupted by
<br>
civilisation. Rousseau, Emerson, Wagner, Nietszche and Frantz Fanon
<br>
should
<br>
be on a list of romantic prophets, and idealist philosophers like Kant
<br>
and
<br>
Hegel arguably are closer to romanticism than to humanism or
<br>
rationalism.
<br>
<p>The American revolution, and the French revolution in its constitutional
<br>
phases, were humanist. The French terror and the Bolshevik terror were
<br>
rationalist. The second world war was a struggle of three secular
<br>
civilisations: humanism (Roosevelt and Churchill), rationalism (Stalin)
<br>
and
<br>
romanticism (Hitler). The war by Islamic radicals against the US, Europe
<br>
and
<br>
Israel is, among other things, a conflict between religious and humanist
<br>
civilisation.
<br>
<p>My claim is that the civilisation shared by most Prospect readers is
<br>
humanist, a relatively young global civilisation based on the
<br>
post-medieval,
<br>
Italian-Dutch-Anglo-American tradition of the constitutional, commercial
<br>
society. Needless to say, this definition of humanist civilisation
<br>
differs
<br>
dramatically from conventional catechisms about the &quot;rise of the west.&quot;
<br>
<p>For example, the familiar idea that there is a unitary liberal &quot;west&quot;
<br>
that
<br>
is defined by the RRE tradition-Renaissance, Reformation and
<br>
Enlightenment-is untrue. Renaissance humanism is incompatible with
<br>
Reformation Protestantism, while Enlightenment rationalism is alien to
<br>
both.
<br>
The fact that these three traditions have coexisted in Britain, the US
<br>
and
<br>
other countries does not mean that they are three phases of the same
<br>
tradition.
<br>
<p>Another version of the &quot;rise of the west&quot; story, more sympathetic to
<br>
Catholicism than the RRE approach, holds that the &quot;west&quot; is a synthesis
<br>
of
<br>
the &quot;Greco-Roman&quot; and &quot;Judaeo-Christian&quot; traditions. In fact, the
<br>
&quot;Judaeo-Christian&quot; tradition has little to do with the tolerant,
<br>
individualist, commercial society.
<br>
<p>Consider the claim that Christianity is responsible for the liberal
<br>
ideal of
<br>
political equality. In reality, early-modern liberal republican
<br>
theorists
<br>
derived this from Cicero and the Stoics. Christians and Muslims believe
<br>
in
<br>
the equality of believers before God, a conception which was not
<br>
interpreted
<br>
until recently to mandate equality. Indeed, Paul admonished slaves to
<br>
return
<br>
to their spiritually-equal masters. The Christian churches only turned
<br>
against chattel slavery after secular philosophers like David Hume had
<br>
begun
<br>
denouncing it. Southern Protestants in the US defended slavery
<br>
throughout
<br>
the civil war, and the Catholic church defended it until it was
<br>
abolished
<br>
decades later in Catholic Cuba and Brazil.
<br>
<p>Popular sovereignty, republicanism, democracy, the rule of law rather
<br>
than
<br>
the rule of men, the idea of a natural law transcending the conventional
<br>
law
<br>
of nations-these, too, are part of a pre-Christian, Greco-Roman heritage
<br>
familiar to educated Europeans and westerners from the Renaissance until
<br>
the
<br>
19th century. Credit for these concepts can no more be given to Moses
<br>
and
<br>
Jesus than to Muhammad.
<br>
<p>But didn't Protestantism produce capitalism? The intellectual historians
<br>
who
<br>
vulgarise Max Weber's nuanced discussion of the affinities between
<br>
Protestantism and capitalism into a cause-and-effect relationship are
<br>
easily
<br>
refuted. Commercial capitalism, in a remarkably familiar form, evolved
<br>
in
<br>
Catholic Europe, particularly in northern Italy, for half a millennium,
<br>
between the 1100s and the 1500s. Only the political repression of Italy
<br>
by
<br>
counter-Reformation Spain gave the lead to northwestern Europe-and there
<br>
capitalism and industry burgeoned in pluralist Holland and in Britain
<br>
after
<br>
the invasion of &quot;Dutch William&quot; in 1689. It did not happen in Puritan
<br>
societies like Calvin's Geneva or Cromwell's England or the Scotland
<br>
tyrannised by the kirk. In the US, the centre of capitalism has been not
<br>
Puritan New England or the Southern Bible Belt, but polyglot, secular,
<br>
permissive Manhattan-formerly known as New Amsterdam.
<br>
<p>What about natural science? Christian apologists nowadays claim that
<br>
Christianity cleared the way for natural science by demythologising the
<br>
world. This would come as news to Pope John Paul II, who in September
<br>
2000
<br>
performed a 30-minute exorcism on a 19-year-old woman who began shouting
<br>
at
<br>
him during a public audience. Evangelical Protestants, as well as
<br>
Catholics,
<br>
believe in demons and engage in exorcism. The conservative Protestant JF
<br>
Cogan says that the growth in the human population, relative to the
<br>
fixed
<br>
number of fallen angels, means that some overworked demons are forced to
<br>
commute among a number of possessed individuals at &quot;the speed of
<br>
electricity.&quot; Even more innovative is the Rev Jim Peasboro of Savannah,
<br>
Georgia, who in his book The Devil in the Machine: Is Your Computer
<br>
Possessed by a Demon? explains that &quot;any PC built after 1985 has the
<br>
storage
<br>
capacity to house an evil spirit.&quot; All this is justified by reference to
<br>
Jesus whose many successful exorcisms are recounted in the New
<br>
Testament.
<br>
<p>Modern natural science was built in the last several centuries on the
<br>
surviving foundations of ancient Hellenic science-the atomism of
<br>
Leucippus
<br>
and Democritus in the 5th and 4th centuries BC, and the heliocentric
<br>
theory
<br>
of Aristarchus (310-230 BC). Like Muslims, Christians repeatedly have
<br>
tried
<br>
to repress science when it threatened their dogmas, from the days of
<br>
Galileo
<br>
until the present, with Protestant fundamentalists in the US still
<br>
waging a
<br>
campaign to ban discussion of Darwinian biology from classrooms or to
<br>
pair
<br>
it with Biblical &quot;creation science.&quot; According to Stephen Hawking, who
<br>
attended a 1981 Vatican conference on cosmology, &quot;the Pope told us that
<br>
it
<br>
was fine to study the evolution of the universe after the big bang, but
<br>
we
<br>
should not inquire into the big bang itself because that was the work of
<br>
God.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, does liberty of conscience have Christian roots? It was only after
<br>
they
<br>
failed to create theocracies on the territories that they controlled in
<br>
the
<br>
wars of religion that Catholics and Calvinists resigned themselves to
<br>
the
<br>
idea of a secular state (to this day, ultramontanist Catholics and
<br>
Protestant theologians dream of theocratic government). After Mussolini
<br>
came
<br>
to power in Italy, Pope Pius XI declared: &quot;if there is a totalitarian
<br>
regime, it is the Church regime, given that man belongs wholly to the
<br>
Church.&quot; (The Vatican did not make its peace with liberal democracy
<br>
until
<br>
the 1960s.) The major Protestant reformers were just as tyrannical.
<br>
&quot;Those
<br>
who object to the punishment of heresy are like dogs and swine,&quot; Calvin
<br>
thundered. Martin Luther was moderate by comparison, writing in 1528: &quot;I
<br>
can
<br>
in no way admit that false teachers should be put to death: it is enough
<br>
that they should be banished.&quot; Of the Jews, the relatively tolerant
<br>
Luther
<br>
wrote: &quot;Burn down their synagogues... force them to work, and deal
<br>
harshly
<br>
with them, as Moses did in the wilderness, slaying 3,000 lest the whole
<br>
people perish... There it would be wrong to be merciful.&quot;
<br>
<p>Apart from maverick Christian minorities like Quakers, Anabaptists and
<br>
Jehovah's Witnesses, the major champions of freedom of thought and
<br>
religious
<br>
tolerance have been secular thinkers and statesmen like Voltaire and
<br>
Thomas
<br>
Jefferson, who wrote, &quot;our civil rights have no dependence upon our
<br>
religious opinions more than our opinions in physics or geometry.&quot;
<br>
Jefferson
<br>
stated that the legislators who passed the Virginian statute protecting
<br>
religious freedom &quot;meant to comprehend within its protection the Jew and
<br>
the
<br>
Gentile, the Christian and Mahometan, the Hindoo and infidel of every
<br>
denomination.&quot;
<br>
<p>Far from being the source of humanist civilisation, then, Christianity
<br>
in
<br>
its traditional forms is incompatible with a liberal, democratic,
<br>
secular
<br>
society that has an economy based on applied science and commercial
<br>
exchange. Indeed, conservative Christianity, in both its Protestant and
<br>
Catholic forms, has always had far less in common with humanist
<br>
civilisation
<br>
than with orthodox Islam. Both orthodox Christianity and orthodox Islam
<br>
are
<br>
intolerant religions which divide humanity into believers and infidels.
<br>
Both
<br>
Christianity and Islam hold that reason must be subordinated to
<br>
irrational
<br>
faith. &quot;Reason is the Devil's whore,&quot; Luther declared. Paul said, &quot;the
<br>
wisdom of the Greeks is the foolishness of God.&quot; The true source of
<br>
humanist
<br>
civilisation, including natural science, democracy and the spirit of
<br>
free
<br>
inquiry, can be traced back through the Romans to the ancient Greeks,
<br>
who
<br>
first replaced mythological thinking with reasoning about humanity and
<br>
the
<br>
universe.
<br>
<p>In the interest of social peace, political elites in the
<br>
English-speaking
<br>
world, as well as in continental Europe, have abandoned intellectual
<br>
consistency by assigning each of these three rival secular traditions
<br>
authority in a different sphere. When discussing politics, Americans use
<br>
the
<br>
language of Renaissance humanist republicanism; when discussing
<br>
business,
<br>
science and technology, they are Cartesian rationalists; when discussing
<br>
morals and religion, they tend to speak a Calvinist language of public
<br>
confession and repentance; and in the arts, they use the German romantic
<br>
categories of genius, originality and inspiration. Now and then there
<br>
are
<br>
collisions as when, every year or two, an exhibit of &quot;blasphemous&quot; art
<br>
illustrates the conflict between Christian and romantic conceptions of
<br>
creativity.
<br>
<p>Even before 11th September, this uneasy compromise showed signs of
<br>
breaking
<br>
down. In the US, the number of secular and only nominally religious
<br>
individuals has been steadily growing, while the number of active
<br>
believers
<br>
has slowly declined. But as a proportion of the shrinking religious
<br>
population, fundamentalist Protestantism, conservative Catholicism and
<br>
orthodox Judaism have been expanding, while mainline Protestantism,
<br>
liberal
<br>
Catholicism and reform and conservative Judaism are losing adherents,
<br>
mostly
<br>
to non-belief. The collapse of liberal denominations promises an
<br>
increasing
<br>
polarisation between consistent secularists and devout believers.
<br>
<p>By the 1990s, right-wing Protestants, Catholics and Jews were setting
<br>
aside
<br>
their differences to wage political war on secularism and humanism. The
<br>
extension of the political alliance of &quot;people of faith&quot; to reactionary
<br>
Muslims, who share their opposition to feminism, gay rights, abortion,
<br>
contraception and freedom from censorship is the logical next step.
<br>
Pressured by fundamentalist Christians, US delegations to international
<br>
family-planning conferences have found themselves allied with Muslim
<br>
theocracies and the Vatican against European and east Asian delegations
<br>
on
<br>
issues of contraception and abortion.
<br>
<p>In the past two decades, many conservative Christians in the US and
<br>
elsewhere have expressed sympathy for aspects of reactionary Islam. In
<br>
1989,
<br>
when a caller to Larry King Live asked then-drug czar William J Bennett,
<br>
&quot;Why build prisons? Get tough like Arabia. Behead the damned drug
<br>
dealers.
<br>
We're just too soft,&quot; Bennett replied, &quot;morally, I don't have any
<br>
problem
<br>
with that,&quot; and went on to call for more executions in the US. Another
<br>
conservative Catholic, Patrick Buchanan, denounced Salman Rushdie for
<br>
writing &quot;a blasphemous assault on the faith of hundreds of millions.&quot; In
<br>
1998, as the Taleban in Afghanistan was banning women from working, the
<br>
Southern Baptist Convention passed a resolution declaring that wives
<br>
should
<br>
&quot;submit graciously to the servant leadership of their husbands.&quot;
<br>
<p>Two days after 11th September, Jerry Falwell, founder of the Moral
<br>
Majority,
<br>
told Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson (on the latter's
<br>
television
<br>
show), that &quot;God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of
<br>
America to give us probably what we deserve.&quot; They agreed that the
<br>
attack
<br>
was God's punishment for American toleration of pagans, abortionists,
<br>
feminists and gays: &quot;I point the finger in their face,&quot; said Falwell.
<br>
&quot;You
<br>
helped this happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>Some conservative Christian intellectuals in the US now openly flirt
<br>
with
<br>
sedition. In 1996, the Catholic priest Richard John Neuhaus hosted a
<br>
symposium in which religious right activists, including Judge Robert
<br>
Bork,
<br>
argued that the US government was so immoral that revolution might be
<br>
legitimate. Two years earlier, at a religious conference in Florida
<br>
devoted
<br>
to &quot;Reclaiming America,&quot; ex-Vice-President Dan Quayle joined the
<br>
audience in
<br>
reciting a theocratic parody of the Pledge of Allegiance: &quot;I pledge
<br>
allegiance to the Christian flag, and to the Saviour, for whose Kingdom
<br>
it
<br>
stands. One Saviour, crucified, risen and coming again, with life and
<br>
liberty for all who believe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Today the Christian right is far more powerful in American politics than
<br>
it
<br>
was in 1800 or 1900. In 1787, Jefferson wrote to his nephew Peter Carr,
<br>
&quot;question with boldness even the existence of a god; because, if there
<br>
be
<br>
one, he must approve the homage of reason rather than of blindfolded
<br>
fear...&quot; Jefferson, who edited a version of the gospels without the
<br>
supernatural parts, reassured his nephew that belief in God was not
<br>
necessary for virtue. Such sentiments did not prevent him from serving
<br>
two
<br>
terms as president. Of Jefferson's rival Alexander Hamilton, the
<br>
historian
<br>
Karl-Friedrich Walling writes, &quot;nothing distinguishes Hamilton from
<br>
Oliver
<br>
Cromwell more than his hatred of Puritanism, religious and political.
<br>
Largely because of the humanity he absorbed from the atheist Hume, he
<br>
was
<br>
less worried that Americans would become decadent or corrupt than that
<br>
they
<br>
would become exceedingly self-righteous.&quot;
<br>
<p>By contrast, in 2000, both the Republican and the Democratic
<br>
presidential
<br>
candidates claimed to be evangelical Protestants who had personally
<br>
&quot;found
<br>
Jesus.&quot; Al Gore's vice-presidential candidate was an orthodox Jew who
<br>
refused to work or travel on the sabbath and claimed that non-believers
<br>
could not be good citizens. That claim by Joseph Lieberman would have
<br>
surprised George Washington, who emphasised the religious neutrality of
<br>
the
<br>
US government in a letter to a Jewish community in Newport, Rhode
<br>
Island,
<br>
written in 1790: &quot;for happily the government of the United States, which
<br>
gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires
<br>
only
<br>
that they who live under its protection, should demean themselves as
<br>
good
<br>
citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.&quot;
<br>
<p>During the 2000 presidential campaign, George W Bush made the
<br>
astonishing
<br>
assertion that &quot;on the issue of evolution, the verdict is still out on
<br>
how
<br>
God created the earth.&quot; One of his predecessors in the White House,
<br>
Woodrow
<br>
Wilson, asked 78 years earlier about his views on evolution, replied
<br>
&quot;that
<br>
of course like very other man of intelligence and education I do believe
<br>
in
<br>
organic evolution. It surprises me that at this late date such questions
<br>
should be raised.&quot; Ex-president Theodore Roosevelt, in a speech
<br>
delivered to
<br>
the American Historical Association in 1912, referred to &quot;the great
<br>
Darwin.&quot;
<br>
In &quot;My Life as a Naturalist,&quot; published in The American Museum Journal
<br>
in
<br>
May 1918, Roosevelt wrote of his childhood education: &quot;Thank Heaven, I
<br>
sat
<br>
at the feet of Darwin and Huxley.&quot;
<br>
<p>Although Christian conservatives now control the national Republican
<br>
party,
<br>
ensuring that no supporter of evolutionary biology, most forms of
<br>
biotech
<br>
research, abortion or gay rights can be nominated for president or
<br>
vice-president, they are not powerful enough to impose their vision on
<br>
society as a whole. The Christian right is finding new allies, however,
<br>
on
<br>
the environmental left.
<br>
<p>Dan Quayle's former chief of staff William Kristol, a crusader against
<br>
abortion and gay rights and editor of Rupert Murdoch's Washington
<br>
magazine
<br>
The Weekly Standard, has teamed up with leftist Jeremy Rifkin to
<br>
persuade
<br>
Congress to ban therapeutic cloning, which is legal in Europe and East
<br>
Asia.
<br>
Under pressure from the religious right, Bush has crippled US stem-cell
<br>
research, causing research projects to move to Britain and other
<br>
countries.
<br>
Rifkin has also joined the Southern Baptists in an effort to outlaw the
<br>
patenting of plant and animal genes.
<br>
<p>Will Protestant and Catholic abortion-clinic bombers soon be
<br>
comrades-in-arms of Greenpeace activists who destroy the
<br>
genetically-modified? The fundamentalist-green alliance against
<br>
technology
<br>
and scientific research is not surprising. After all, for the past
<br>
quarter
<br>
century, Darwinian evolutionary psychology has been attacked by the left
<br>
(which believes that human nature is infinitely malleable) and by the
<br>
religious right (which believes in the Hebrew creation myth). Both the
<br>
religious right and a large part of the romantic left share an Arcadian
<br>
vision, similar to that of secular fascists and Muslim conservatives, of
<br>
a
<br>
static, pre-modern, rural community of spiritual people who have not
<br>
been
<br>
alienated from nature and God by secularism and capitalism.
<br>
<p>The fundamentalist-green alliance has already found a spokesman in
<br>
former
<br>
vice-president Al Gore. Gore, a divinity school student and born-again
<br>
Baptist whose desk had a sign with the motto WWJD (What Would Jesus
<br>
Do?),
<br>
fused Christian and environmentalist clichés in his 1992 bestseller,
<br>
Earth
<br>
in the Balance. Calling environmental problems an &quot;ungodly crisis,&quot; Gore
<br>
echoes both the religious right and the Luddite left when he declares,
<br>
&quot;the
<br>
froth and frenzy of industrial civilisation mask our deep loneliness for
<br>
that communion with the world that can lift our spirits and fill our
<br>
senses
<br>
with the richness and immediacy of life itself.&quot; Praising ecological
<br>
activists as &quot;resistance fighters,&quot; Gore predicts &quot;a global civil war
<br>
between those who refuse to consider the consequences of civilisation's
<br>
relentless advance and those who refuse to be silent partners in the
<br>
destruction.&quot;
<br>
<p>The greatest villain in history, according to Gore, is none other than
<br>
Francis Bacon, philosopher of the scientific method. &quot;Bacon's moral
<br>
confusion-the confusion at the heart of much modern science-came from
<br>
his
<br>
assumption, echoing Plato, that human intellect could safely analyse and
<br>
understand the natural world without reference to any moral principles
<br>
defining our relationship and duties to both God and God's creation.&quot;
<br>
According to Gore, science must be returned to supervision by religious
<br>
elites.
<br>
<p>The dismissal of Charles Darwin by George W Bush and the denunciation of
<br>
Francis Bacon by Al Gore show how far the US has drifted from the
<br>
enlightened humanism of the founding fathers. Jefferson's three greatest
<br>
heroes were Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, and John Locke. Hamilton's was
<br>
Julius Caesar. Neither Jefferson nor Hamilton considered listing either
<br>
Moses or Jesus. That oversight was remedied during the 2000 presidential
<br>
campaign, when George W Bush, asked to name his favourite philosopher,
<br>
replied, &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot;
<br>
<p>Humanist civilisation, then, is threatened today both from beyond its
<br>
borders and from inside them. Liberal democracies may be able to resist
<br>
Muslim terrorism, but the greatest long-running threat to secularism,
<br>
democracy and science could come from within, from the emerging
<br>
coalition of
<br>
the religious right and the romantic left brought together by a loathing
<br>
for
<br>
open society that they share with each other-and with Osama bin Laden.
