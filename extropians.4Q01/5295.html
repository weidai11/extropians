I think I had missed out some points in the earlier consolidated reply that I should take note of.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; What you have stated seems to make solid sense. But it isn't our world today as its currently constituted amongst nation states
<br>
and ethnic groups. I surmise that the format for such a civilization order, as you have listed in your post, suggests massive
<br>
changes in global human society, pre-occurring this development. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, not just massive changes in policy but massive changes in thinking of the world leaders as well as the &quot;common&quot; citizens.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Your post is prefigured in Hans Moravec's Robot, in the paragraphs titled, &quot;The Death of Capitalism,&quot; in which Moravec predicts
<br>
the collapse of traditional capitalism through the application of advanced robot technology (what else?). Moravec envisions the
<br>
nations of the world be transfigured into tribal units, as the great cities decline and the populations are distributed, and
<br>
supplied by good and serviced literally piped in, or produced in situ. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This sounds like a utopia, however, the Federation does not intend to set up a utopia. It might turn out that this scenario happens
<br>
to follow the lines of the federation proposal.
<br>
<p>I would probably find it interesting to read the book, though. Apologies for fiction lovers, I read far more non-fiction books than
<br>
fictional ones, even my favorite: sci-fi. Only thanks to some of you here (on Extropy list) did I read things like &quot;A fire upon the
<br>
deep&quot; otherwise without which I would remain happily ignorant of cutting edge sci-fi.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; I respectfully maintain (not that anyone seems to care ;-)  )  that this epoch is definitively NOT here yet, and its dangerously
<br>
premature, and potential damaging to our national/global economy. Not everyone will see things as you do and even game theory is not
<br>
based on anything that excludes Reciprocity and Mutuality. Your goal and rule-set is admirable, but if Saddam decides to pee in the
<br>
soup while you employ  your meta-goals, we all could get screwed. We need new technologies in-hand, for something as you have
<br>
described to work. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>The original proposal I posted here does not intend to apply it to all the states of this world. In fact, I started work on Project
<br>
Sociologistics and the Ascension Colony Project with the pessimistic (but probably realistic) assumption that only new civilizations
<br>
in space would consider this approach. It does not aim to revolutionize world politics in any case, but more of as an afterthought.
<br>
<p>The Earth-based societies would most likely remain too entangled in their old thinking to consider such. I also suspect that only in
<br>
such a colony would the Singularity develop, hence the Project Sociologistics does intend to require sentient AI. Earth nations
<br>
would probably ban research into such sentient AI, thinking that it would cause great disturbance to their power structures as well
<br>
as taking a big risk, perhaps using the UN to force all member countries to do so.
<br>
<p><p>The thinking of &quot;ideological communities&quot; still remain alien to many, perhaps because quite a lot of people have no purpose and no
<br>
ideology in life. When I suggest this idea, one person even called it a &quot;cult&quot;. Some who do not understand what I mean have no
<br>
qualms calling it &quot;communist&quot; too and mistakenly see both projects as one single project. Others point me to references to some
<br>
island states without considering their relatively &quot;closed sourced&quot;, old thinking and of course, usual lack of ideology.
<br>
<p>In fact, many find it difficult to consider setting up a space colony easier than changing existing society. They complain about the
<br>
costs and technical difficulties and classify it as daydreaming. Yet, the main difficulty lies with the self-reinforcing structures
<br>
our societies had built up over the many years they operate to prevent radical change (including laws, bureaucracy, police,
<br>
military, propaganda and lots more). One would sometimes find it easier to excavate a mountain than to get one's government to
<br>
change an inefficient law.
<br>
<p>Without the evolutionary equivalent of a meteor strike, the dinosaurs would remain living happily on planet Earth. I agree with you
<br>
in this aspect.
<br>
<p><p>I hereby again, strongly suggest that we seriously consider building a space-based community rather than an Earth-based one, and
<br>
focusing design-ahead issues on the social related problems than the technological ones. If we can't stop fighting with ourselves,
<br>
inventing nanotech would have little use but to up the stakes. If we don't even dare to venture into the unknown, or let others do
<br>
so, then the daydreaming of technology blowing all obstacles away would have little use. If we still have such petty quarrels with
<br>
when we live in outer space, I think very few aliens would like to befriend us.
<br>
<p>Please consider this seriously, especially before writing your next sci-fi story or building another new society. Incidentally, if
<br>
anyone would like to write a sci-fi story on Project Sociologistics or the Ascension Colony, I would like to participate too.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; I think you must be confusing &quot;global optimum&quot; and &quot;perfection&quot;. Mistrusting the search for perfection is a common human
<br>
heuristic, which is often quite correct in an imperfect world where predictions of perfection are more often produced by wishful
<br>
thinking than by an unbiased model of a real opportunity for perfection.  Of course, exporting this heuristic into the
<br>
superintelligent spaces is more often the product of anthropomorphism than of principled analysis. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I start to suspect that either a global optimum for human societies does not exist, or more than one such optimum exists. However,
<br>
the proof of this conjecture remains far from our grasp because it requires more computational resources (, massive datasets and
<br>
amazing new techniques) that our puny human minds cannot hold, cannot compute or had not invented.
<br>
<p>I purposely mentioned &quot;human societies&quot; because even transhumans would have problems in their societies that they themselves cannot
<br>
solve (as in the smarter you get the more complex problems that arise). To get a rather simplified view of this, imagine trying to
<br>
understand how your own brain functions. Then imagine attempting to  understanding how these brains function and interact with each
<br>
other, in ways both observed and not observed (but possible).
<br>
<p><p>Hence, Project Sociologistics does not concern itself exclusively with mathematical analysis and highly simplified but unrealistic
<br>
assumptions on solving problems (unlike the flawed approach taken by conventional economics). The problems encountered have far too
<br>
much complexity than this alone can handle.
<br>
<p>It wishes to use an alternative approach of systems theory, fuzzy experiments and heuristics, rather than proofs and calculations,
<br>
to tackle this highly complex problem. It does not view parts of the system as standing by themselves but instead as a &quot;whole&quot; of
<br>
interlinked connections.
<br>
<p>More importantly, it challenges the old and traditional views of the past. It asks us to consider if sentient beings and their
<br>
societies should have a higher purpose beyond that of merely surviving or the mere pursuit of self-interest. It asks us to consider
<br>
the prospect of tolerance implemented with communities than within a community. It asks us to consider multiple solutions to our
<br>
problems instead of declaring that only one's own solution has validity. It tells us to uproot our thinking from the past and plant
<br>
it into the future so that we shall not go crashing into blind ravines ever so often because (as David McLuhan's wrote) we know the
<br>
future by looking only at the back of the car with the side-mirror.
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt; Hm.  Well, your Sandberg Federation must be an absolutist solution too, since it doesn't seem to allow for communities disobeying
<br>
the laws of physics. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Gödel's Theorem rears its head again. You can't have complete knowledge and a complete yet consistent solution. Even Gödel's Theorem
<br>
has incompleteness because it does not apply to itself (or no such theorem can exist due to mutual contradiction).
<br>
<p>In such a case, we have little choice but to forge ahead with this instead of twisting logic to prove it. If we should come up with
<br>
a better system, then we can consider that system, but if not, then we should probably stick to this system (as how Intellicracy
<br>
goes).
