<p>Okay, here it is again, along with my comments. Note that this is just

the bits I snipped out -- I'm in the grip of a bad dose of RSI right now

so I am _not_ going to do a detailed rebuttal to the entire article.

<p><em>&gt; Down With Democracy by Hans-Hermann Hoppe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/hermann-hoppe2.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One-man-one-vote combined with 'free entry' into government - democracy -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies that every person and his personal property comes within reach of -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and is up for grabs by - everyone else. ...
</em><br>
<p>This assumes that democracy comes with no system of checks and balances.
<br>
As it happens, all the participants in a democracy have a personal
<br>
incentive for preserving their own property rights -- their own. This
<br>
is maximized in societies where social mobility -- upwards, as well
<br>
as downwards -- is maximized; the greater Joe Average's prospects for
<br>
maximizing their personal wealth, the greater the incentive Joe Average
<br>
has for not over-taxing the very rich.
<br>
<p>He's also neatly side-stepped the issue of constitutional or basic laws
<br>
that prevent a democracy from making fundamental changes without achieving
<br>
near-unanimous, as opposed to majority, support. Bring in such provisions
<br>
and his whole argument falls through.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                                   .... The rich are characteristically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bright and industrious, and the poor typically dull, lazy, or both.
</em><br>
<p>He missed out &quot;sickly&quot; or &quot;unlucky&quot;.
<br>
<p>I have a friend who has a medical degree. She's damn near bankruptcy. Not
<br>
through high living, but because she didn't get on with the medical
<br>
establishment, and so went into practice as a homeopath -- then had a run
<br>
of really bad luck (buying a home in a neighbourhood where property values
<br>
were going downhill, moving out and leasing it to an asshole who defaulted
<br>
on the rent and skipped out of the country, that sort of thing).
<br>
<p>Hoppe is advancing an argument based on social determinism, not realism: in
<br>
his universe, everybody gets what they deserve. We, as extropians, are
<br>
supposed to believe in self-improvement. A corollary of this is that it's
<br>
possible for *other* people to improve ... including those who we might
<br>
currently see as social basket-cases. Whereas Hoppe is espousing the
<br>
position &quot;once a peasant, always a peasant&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... The recognition of democracy as a machinery of popular wealth and income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redistribution,
</em><br>
<p>And insurance.
<br>
<p>Something we tend to forget is that the modern welfare state, with the
<br>
concepts of a state pension, a retirement age, unemployment insurance
<br>
and health cover, was invented by that notorious pinko liberal commie
<br>
Prince Otto von Bismarck.
<br>
<p>Bismarck didn't turn Kaiserine Germany into a welfare state because
<br>
he figured Marx was right; he did so because he saw it as a sensible
<br>
safety net that would allow him to follow disruptive policies (rapid
<br>
industrialisation of a hitherto not-very-industrialised country) without
<br>
causing social unrest. His calculation was that if the workers knew they
<br>
wouldn't die of starvation, they'd be less inclined to revolt.
<br>
<p>Our modern social systems tend to act as insurance -- insurance against
<br>
disease, insurance against unemployment, insurance against old age. And
<br>
I maintain that in principle a government-run or government-mandated
<br>
central insurance system can be cheaper and more efficient than any
<br>
private-sector profit-making insurance agency. For one thing, it doesn't
<br>
have to cream off profits to stuff into the shareholder's pockets. For
<br>
another thing, it can _prevent_ the tragedy of the commons within its 
<br>
remit by legislative fiat, by ensuring that contributions (and benefits)
<br>
are universally applied. Of course, you have the question of efficiency:
<br>
but the US government is notorious for its inability to run a bureaucracy
<br>
efficiently. From where I'm standing (the UK), national-scale insurance
<br>
schemes make more sense than private enterprise schemes.
<br>
<p>We therefore have an area in which income redistribution makes general
<br>
sense (insurance) and it looks like professor Hoppe has completely
<br>
forgotten about this.
<br>
<p>(It is of no benefit to a nobleman to pay no taxes or heed to the 
<br>
peasantry if he falls ill and his medical bills gobble up his entire
<br>
wealth.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;               .... provides the key to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding of the present age.
</em><br>
<p>That's bollocks. (My personal opinion.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                                  ... By forcing businessmen, through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'affirmative action' ('non-discrimination') programs, to employ more women,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homosexuals, blacks, or other 'minorities' than they would like to, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be more employed minorities, and fewer employers and fewer male,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heterosexual, and white employment.
</em><br>
<p>He tends to forget that, oddly, homosexuals, blacks, and other minorities
<br>
need to work to live, as do white heterosexual christian males. (This is
<br>
the &quot;fewer jobs to go round&quot; falacy that used to be trotted out by the
<br>
neo-fascist right in the UK in the 1970's, until even their half-witted
<br>
followers saw through it.) In reality, what he's objecting to is the idea
<br>
that discrimination is bad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most importantly, by compelling private property owners and/or market income
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earners (producers) to subsidize 'politicians', 'political parties', and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'civil servants' (politicians and government employees do not pay taxes but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are paid out of taxes), there will be less wealth formation, fewer producers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and less productivity, and ever more waste, 'parasites' and parasitism.
</em><br>
<p>He forgets that civil servants spend money. That money goes into providing
<br>
jobs in the general economy. Abolish the US government overnight and you'd
<br>
probably cause Boeing, Lockheed, and a host of other huge corporations
<br>
to go bankrupt -- and trigger a full-on depression -- because you'd be
<br>
reducing the velocity of money.
<br>
<p>The point to note is that most people in our post-industrial society are
<br>
*not* primary producers (farmers or builders or engineers). We've gotten so
<br>
efficient at those tasks that we need barely 5%-10% of our population to
<br>
do that. So the trick we need to master is to keep the money circulating
<br>
and to find use for otherwise-idle (and starving) hands.
<br>
<p>A classic case of this fallacy occured in the UK in 1979-81. Margaret
<br>
Thatcher looked at the British government's nationalised (state-owned)
<br>
industries and saw that several of them were making large net losses. She
<br>
cut them off at the ankles and they shut down -- we lost 70% of the steel
<br>
industry in about six months, for example.
<br>
<p>The effect on the economy was drastic. About a million people ended up
<br>
on the dole. Prior to this, they'd been earning an average of £10K each,
<br>
paying maybe £2K in taxes, and receiving a subsidy (to their industry)
<br>
of about £1K per head. Afterwards, they were drawing £2K a head in
<br>
unemployment benefits. The net effect on government revenues was to DOUBLE
<br>
outgoings, while the net effect on the economy was to shrink it by several
<br>
percentage points; they went from a net contribution of £9K each to a 
<br>
deficit of £2K each.
<br>
<p>(Thatcher expected them all to get jobs doing something else productive.
<br>
As it happens, large numbers of them are now nearning retirement age ...
<br>
with no new jobs in sight. You can't easily re-train steelworkers into 
<br>
stockbrokers or computer programmers; some will make the change, but
<br>
many can't.)
<br>
<p>The point is, money spent on government services may or may not be
<br>
productive but *it's part of the economy*. Money spent on government
<br>
employee wages ends up coming back in taxes *and in spending in the
<br>
private sector*.  Maybe we'd be better off in a minarchist utopia,
<br>
but the road we'd have to walk to get there would be incredibly painful.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Hoppe is trying to blame everything on misplaced egalitarianism
<br>
and the values that surfaced during the Enlightenment. His vision of the
<br>
human world is one where everybody has an assigned place, nobody should
<br>
move from it, and if you're poor you're doomed to stay that way.
<br>
<p>Extropian it ain't; mediaeval, maybe.
