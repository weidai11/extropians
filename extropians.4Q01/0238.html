Hoppe Revisited by Rick Gee
<br>
<p>from <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/gee4.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/gee4.html</a>
<br>
<p>Several writers in this space have recommended Hans-Hermann Hoppe's seminal
<br>
essay The Private Production of Defense [downloaded from
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf">http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/14_1/14_1_2.pdf</a>]. I too recommend it,
<br>
especially now in light of the events of September 11, 2001.
<br>
<p>Hoppe argues persuasively that collective security provided by the state is
<br>
perforce inferior to that which would be provided by private insurance
<br>
agencies. Because large insurance companies, many of them multinational
<br>
conglomerates, have vast financial resources and would be in competition
<br>
with each other for a staggering amount of business, they would be far more
<br>
efficient than monopolistic government police forces.
<br>
<p>Hoppe states in the opening paragraph, &quot;Among the most popular and
<br>
consequential beliefs of our age is the belief in collective security.
<br>
Nothing less significant than the legitimacy of the modern state rests on
<br>
this belief.&quot; He calls this belief a myth, and ascribes it to English
<br>
philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who believed that man, left to his own devices,
<br>
would be in a constant state of conflict. According to Hobbes, the solution
<br>
to this circumstance is the institution of a state.
<br>
<p>The problem with this theory as Hoppe sees it is that men who are
<br>
essentially combative are the same men who will make up the state: &quot;Man's
<br>
nature is not transformed upon becoming (the state).&quot; Additionally, the
<br>
state must levy taxes in order to provide collective security, a situation
<br>
that Hoppe accurately describes as a protection racket.
<br>
<p>If men are naturally confrontational, and these same men comprise the state,
<br>
it follows that it will be impossible for states themselves to maintain
<br>
peace. In fact, states will be even less peaceful toward others than will
<br>
individuals because states can externalize the cost of their behavior by
<br>
expropriating tax dollars from their subjects.
<br>
<p>Hoppe believes &quot;... that the Hobbesian myth is accepted more or less
<br>
unquestioningly by well over 90 percent of the adult population.&quot; Does this
<br>
sound familiar? Polls immediately following the attack on the WTC and the
<br>
Pentagon indicated that 86% of Americans support the U.S. government going
<br>
to war &quot;to put an end to terrorist attacks,&quot; that is, to provide protection
<br>
and security. Hoppe continues, &quot;However, to believe something does not make
<br>
it true. Rather, if what one believes is false, one's actions will lead to
<br>
failure.&quot;
<br>
<p>It cannot be denied that our government failed to protect its own citizens
<br>
in New York, or its own employees at the Pentagon. Apparently the only
<br>
people that were able to protect others from a similar calamity were a group
<br>
of (private) heroes who were successful in resisting the hijackers on United
<br>
flight 93 to the extent that they were able to force the plane to crash into
<br>
a barren section of Pennsylvania, rather than its intended target,
<br>
speculated to be the Capitol or White House, thereby saving perhaps
<br>
thousands more lives.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, &quot;the U.S. government has become entangled in hundreds of
<br>
foreign conflicts and risen to the rank of the world's dominant imperialist
<br>
power. Thus nearly every president since the turn of this (20th) century
<br>
also has been responsible for the murder, killing, or starvation of
<br>
countless innocent foreigners all over the world.&quot; Is it not clear that
<br>
this, and not an envy of our freedom and capitalism, as the politicians and
<br>
the compliant media tell us, has provoked the hatred and motivation of Osama
<br>
bin Laden and his ilk?
<br>
<p>Hoppe summarizes his belief that the existence of the imperial state is the
<br>
problem rather than the solution when it comes to security and protection:
<br>
&quot;The U.S. government does not protect us. To the contrary, there exists no
<br>
greater danger to our life, property, and prosperity than the U.S.
<br>
government ...&quot;
<br>
<p>This contention is borne out in the current situation. The actions of our
<br>
own government have posed grave danger to life (U.S provocation leading to
<br>
perhaps 10,000 of our own citizens dying in one day, with the deaths of
<br>
countless innocent foreigners sure to come), property (the World Trade
<br>
Center Twin Towers reduced to rubble) and prosperity (airlines going
<br>
bankrupt, likely to be bailed out by your tax dollars; $40 billion and
<br>
counting handed to the president by Congress; the Fed printing over $100
<br>
billion in fiat currency in two days, coupled with more interest rate cuts -
<br>
inflationary policies that act as hidden taxes).
<br>
<p>&quot;... the U.S. president in particular is the world's single most threatening
<br>
and armed danger, capable of ruining everyone who opposes him and destroying
<br>
the entire globe.&quot;
<br>
<p>Congress has approved a resolution authorizing President Bush to &quot;use all
<br>
necessary and appropriate force&quot; against those involved in Tuesday's deadly
<br>
terrorist attacks. Those who don't line up behind Bush will surely be
<br>
considered enemies, whether they are foreign or domestic. And with
<br>
everything on the table militarily, including nuclear weapons, it is not a
<br>
stretch to imagine that global warfare will be the result.
<br>
<p>While we can plainly see that Hoppe foresaw the recent events insofar as
<br>
they were caused by actions of the state, how is it that they could have
<br>
been avoided in a Hoppean world? He argues that insurers would protect us
<br>
from state aggression, just as they would from the aggression of
<br>
individuals. Because governments &quot;are inherently wasteful and inefficient in
<br>
whatever they do, (including) weapons technology and production, military
<br>
intelligence and strategy,&quot; they would be unable to compete with private
<br>
insurance agencies whose profit motive would lead to superior efficiency.
<br>
Further, agents of a state would be regarded as unwelcome interlopers,
<br>
leading to emigration of residents of state-controlled territories to free
<br>
territories, thus weakening those governments.
<br>
<p>Even if a free territory were to be attacked or invaded by a state, &quot;the
<br>
aggressor would not encounter an unarmed population.&quot; In this instance, the
<br>
hijackers armed with knives and the bluff of a bomb would have been met by
<br>
superior firepower held by the free men and women on those planes. More
<br>
likely, the hijackings would never have occurred. Hoppe points out that
<br>
insurers would have no desire to disarm their clients. On the contrary, it
<br>
is states that seek to disarm their subjects in order to make the plunder of
<br>
taxation easier to affect.
<br>
<p>Moreover, an invading state would likely be met by multiple insurance firms.
<br>
Should the attack succeed, said insurance firms would be responsible for
<br>
enormous indemnification payments. In order to preclude making those
<br>
payments, insurers would be prepared to defend their clients by possessing
<br>
superior intelligence, weapons and personnel. Hoppe envisions a two-pronged
<br>
strategy: repelling or eliminating invaders and minimizing collateral damage
<br>
(in stark contrast to, say, Madeline Albright); and targeting the offending
<br>
state for reprisal, hoping to encourage opposition to that government,
<br>
possibly leading to the transformation of the state to a free territory.
<br>
<p>Clearly in a Hoppean climate, the tragic events of September 11 would never
<br>
have occurred. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. What will it make it
<br>
reality? Again, Hoppe shows the way: &quot;Without the erroneous public
<br>
perception and judgment of the state as just and necessary and without the
<br>
public's voluntary cooperation, even the seemingly most powerful government
<br>
would implode and its powers evaporate.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hoppe also invokes Murray Rothbard from Power and Market. &quot;It follows that
<br>
just as socialism cannot be reformed but must be abolished in order to
<br>
achieve prosperity, so can the institution of a state not be reformed but
<br>
must be abolished in order to achieve justice and protection.&quot;
<br>
<p>That eventuality seems remote right now. But it is up to us to make it
<br>
happen. Talk to everyone you know who will listen about the advantages of
<br>
liberty. Print out The Private Production of Defense and mail it to your
<br>
friends. Send them articles via email from this site, Antiwar.com and other
<br>
appropriate sites. Go in with friends and buy 100 copies of Frederic
<br>
Bastiat's The Law for $150 from Laissez Faire Books and give one to everyone
<br>
on your Christmas list.
<br>
<p>Perhaps if we do this, and it becomes apparent in five or ten years that the
<br>
government has not ended terrorism despite the expenditure of hundreds of
<br>
billions of dollars and the slaughter of tens of thousands of people, the
<br>
vision of Hans-Hermann Hoppe can be realized.
