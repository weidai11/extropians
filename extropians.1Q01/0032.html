Technology: Building Better Humans
<br>
The great decision ahead of us is philosophical-do we want our new machines
<br>
to be like us? Or should we be more like our machines? And does it matter?
<br>
<p>By Peter McGrath
<br>
NEWSWEEK
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan. 2001 -  In August 1998 Kevin Warwick put his body on the network.
<br>
He had a silicon chip surgically implanted in his left arm, enabling a
<br>
computer at the University of Reading, England, to track him throughout the
<br>
Department of Cybernetics, where he teaches. Over the next nine days, the
<br>
computer would recognize him as he arrived at the main entrance, and its
<br>
voice box would greet him. It opened his lab door for him. It turned on the
<br>
lights. The experiment had a danger: the glass tube containing the implant
<br>
could have shattered inside him.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BUT IT WAS WORTH THE RISK to find whether an implant could
<br>
communicate with a computer Warwick's next experiment, probably sometime
<br>
next spring, will test an implant's ability to shuttle signals between his
<br>
nervous system and a computer-a radical step toward linking brain and
<br>
machine directly. And after that? Perhaps an implant that does internal
<br>
processing, if he can develop one small enough. &quot;The potential for humans,
<br>
if we stick to our present physical form, is pretty limited,&quot; says Warwick.
<br>
&quot;The opportunity for me to become a cyborg is extremely exciting. I can't
<br>
wait to get on with it.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The future enters into us long before it happens, the German poet
<br>
Rainer Maria Rilke once said. This is no longer a metaphor. The future is
<br>
entering us. We eat genetically modified food. We submit to implanted
<br>
devices that go well beyond the familiar heart pacemaker. We tinker with
<br>
human tissue, developing artificial bone and skin for transplantation. We
<br>
are on the verge of &quot;smart&quot; prosthetics, such as retinal implants that
<br>
restore vision in damaged eyes. Such devices will ultimately be networked,
<br>
allowing, say, a subcutaneous chip to transmit a person's entire medical
<br>
history to a physician far away. Peter Cochrane, the former chief
<br>
technologist for British Telecom, envisions a world where chip implants are
<br>
commonplace and &quot;as desirable as mobile phones.&quot; Rodney Brooks, the director
<br>
of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
<br>
Technology, goes even further. Over time, he says, &quot;we will become our
<br>
machines.&quot;
<br>
<p>HUMAN HYBRIDS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the word &quot;cyborg&quot; first appeared in the middle of the 20th
<br>
century, it was strictly the stuff of science fiction. Everybody knew you
<br>
couldn't put human physiology under mechanical or electronic control. You
<br>
couldn't stitch technology into tissue. The idea of, say, an implant of
<br>
neural circuits inside the skull-proposed by Brooks as a cure for cerebellum
<br>
damage-would have been at best distasteful. The notion of a hybrid human
<br>
would have seemed like sacrilege.
<br>
&nbsp;Today some researchers believe that cyborgs will be possible within 50
<br>
years, or at least that humans will have so many manufactured parts as to be
<br>
virtually indistinguishable from cyborgs.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was then. Today some researchers believe that cyborgs will be
<br>
possible within 50 years, or at least that humans will have so many
<br>
manufactured parts as to be virtually indistinguishable from cyborgs.
<br>
Machines might be so assimilated to us-or we to them-as to raise the most
<br>
fundamental questions. As technology fills you up with synthetic parts, at
<br>
what point do you cease to be fully human? One quarter? One third? Which
<br>
part of us is irreplaceably human, such that if we augmented it with
<br>
technology we would become some other kind of being? The brain? Or is the
<br>
brain merely a conductive medium, our humanity defined more by the content
<br>
of our thought and the intensity of our emotions than by the neural
<br>
circuitry? At bottom lies one critical issue for a technological age: are
<br>
some kinds of knowledge so terrible they simply should not be pursued? If
<br>
there can be such a thing as a philosophical crisis, this will be it. These
<br>
questions, says Rushworth Kidder, president of the Institute for Global
<br>
Ethics in Camden, Maine, are especially vexing because they lie at &quot;the
<br>
convergence of three domains-technology, politics and ethics-that are so far
<br>
hardly on speaking terms.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have always been dangerous technologies. The 20th century,
<br>
which might as well be called the age of industrialized murder, is only the
<br>
most obvious example. But technology is upping the ante by creating fields
<br>
where benign intentions could lead to brutal outcomes. This was the point of
<br>
an article in the April issue of Wired magazine by Bill Joy, the chief
<br>
scientist at Sun Microsystems. Under the title &quot;The Future Doesn't Need Us,&quot;
<br>
Joy described advances in three fields: genetic engineering, nanotechnology
<br>
and robotics. The first has created the possibility of gene therapy that
<br>
would at least bring diseases like cancer under control. The second is an
<br>
umbrella term for technologies that manipulate matter on the ultrasmall
<br>
scale of nanometers, or millionths of a millimeter. Nanotechnology would
<br>
enable the creation of novel plant species or new viruses. Finally, robotics
<br>
will eventually raise the possibility of intelligent and self-replicating
<br>
machines whose processes so closely mimic ours that we will wonder if the
<br>
only difference between them and us is that our life form is based on
<br>
carbon.
<br>
<p>THE LIMITS OF SILICON
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three of these technologies depend on a fourth: the continued
<br>
growth in computing power. It's expected that in about 10 years, engineers
<br>
will reach the limits of their ability to put circuitry onto silicon chips.
<br>
But alternatives to silicon are under development. One involves &quot;biological
<br>
computation,&quot; in which DNA or another biological molecule serves as a
<br>
processing medium. Another derives from the counterintuitive principles of
<br>
quantum mechanics: working at the subatomic level, a quantum computer could
<br>
exist in multiple states at the same time, enabling multiple calculations in
<br>
parallel. So promising are these ideas that Joy expects the computers of
<br>
2040 to be a million times faster than today's machines. Putting it another
<br>
way, he says, a calculation that now would take a lifetime could be carried
<br>
out in half an hour.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At these speeds, technology acquires the inexorability of the ocean
<br>
tides. But is human civilization equipped to keep pace? Engineers tend to
<br>
associate history with progress. But what in our history inspires confidence
<br>
in our ability to channel technology away from destructive uses? &quot;Technology
<br>
is evolving a thousand times faster than our ability to change our social
<br>
institutions,&quot; says Joy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if bioengineering really can &quot;turn off&quot; cancer cells, what's
<br>
wrong with that? If nanotechnology can develop devices that extend our
<br>
physically active lives for decades, is that a problem? If robots can for
<br>
most purposes end our need to do physical labor, should we object? Joy's
<br>
answer was that &quot;with each of these technologies, a sequence of small,
<br>
individually sensible advances leads to an accumulation of great power and,
<br>
concomitantly, great danger.&quot; Unlike 20th-century technologies like nuclear
<br>
weapons, which were self-limiting because they depended on scarce and
<br>
expensive raw materials, the new technologies could produce &quot;accidents and
<br>
abuses [that] are widely within the reach of individuals or small groups...
<br>
Knowledge alone will enable the use of them.&quot; And, he added, &quot;this
<br>
destructiveness [will] be hugely amplified by the power of
<br>
&nbsp;self-replication.&quot; Nanotechnology could create viruses that reproduce
<br>
uncontrollably and blanket the planet. Intelligent robots could make copies
<br>
of themselves and eventually displace people. The extinction of the human
<br>
species, Joy wrote, is all too conceivable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The article was an instant sensation (except in Silicon Valley,
<br>
where, Joy says, &quot;dot-bomb has displaced any other topic&quot;). Theologian
<br>
Leonard Sweet of Drew University called it &quot;the opening salvo of the 21st
<br>
century.&quot; Scientists took it seriously, especially those who had worked on
<br>
advanced weapons programs; in the famous words of J. Robert Oppenheimer,
<br>
they had &quot;known sin.&quot; Besides, the writer was not some Luddite from the
<br>
Birkenstock-and-health-food set. As the developer of high-end computer
<br>
architectures going back more than 20 years, Joy had credibility. Still,
<br>
many in the technology sector thought he overstated his case. &quot;The
<br>
science-fiction version of nanotechnology is very different from real
<br>
nanotechnology,&quot; Rodney Brooks said pointedly at the recent Camden
<br>
Technology Conference in Maine. Joy himself says that &quot;if your concern is
<br>
that somebody will program Frankenstein's monster, your concern is probably
<br>
misplaced.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One problem is that Joy was asking his colleagues to think 50 years
<br>
out. That is too far, says Sherry Turkle, a social psychologist at MIT and
<br>
the author of &quot;Life on the Screen.&quot; Her own work is at ground level,
<br>
focusing now on robotic dolls, the first commercial version of which came
<br>
out last month from Hasbro. My Real Baby uses an array of sensors to detect
<br>
light and motion, as well as when her skin is being touched. According to
<br>
codeveloper iRobot of Somerville, Massachusetts, she &quot;knows&quot; when she's
<br>
being hugged, rocked and even burped. She can respond in an &quot;emotionlike&quot;
<br>
way, with one of hundreds of facial expressions, and can draw on billions of
<br>
different sound combinations. She seems to have moods. She requires
<br>
&quot;nurture.&quot; In other words, she presents herself to a child as a being of
<br>
equal dignity and worth. My Real Baby is a seductive machine, says Turkle:
<br>
&quot;We have to fear not so much the computers as our responses-not so much that
<br>
the computers are going to take over as that we'll become like the
<br>
computers... that we'll begin to experience ourselves as machines.&quot;
<br>
<p>NO SOUL?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what?&quot; say many researchers in the fields of artificial
<br>
intelligence and robotics. Brooks, for one, foresees a gradual convergence
<br>
of humans and intelligent implants, to the point that the difference between
<br>
the two becomes both physiologically and philosophically meaningless. Even
<br>
with humans, he says, &quot;there is nothing beyond physical principles going on.
<br>
There is no soul, no elixir of life, nothing beyond molecules working
<br>
together in the mindless, fixed ways that the physics of their constituent
<br>
particles dictates.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter philosophy. The most common definitions of &quot;human&quot; proceed
<br>
from an assertion of an intelligence unique to us, but this is precisely
<br>
what technology is eroding. Is there a type of intelligence computers could
<br>
not acquire? Is, for example, intelligence the capacity to innovate? Is it
<br>
the ability to criticize your own projects and values-in computing terms,
<br>
the ability to override your instruction set? How about the ability to
<br>
create by accident? Great innovations can occur ambiguously: one winner of
<br>
this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry was Hideki Shirakawa, whose laboratory
<br>
mistake led to the development of conductive polymers. If cyborgs are less
<br>
error-prone than humans, might they be less creative? And what about sheer
<br>
fancifulness? Albert Einstein always said that thinking like a child was
<br>
what enabled him to hit upon the theory of relativity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the measure of humanity is a philosophical matter.
<br>
Philosophy, however, has almost nothing to say about such things. Academic
<br>
philosophers spent much of the last century bankrupting their discipline.
<br>
With a few honorable exceptions, they preoccupied themselves with questions
<br>
of method and nomenclature, such as: under what linguistic conditions would
<br>
it be meaningful to ask about the definition of &quot;the human&quot;? As Bernard
<br>
Williams wrote in his 1972 book &quot;Morality&quot;: &quot;Contemporary moral philosophy
<br>
has found an original way of being boring, which is by not discussing moral
<br>
issues at all.&quot;   Newsweek.MSNBC.com
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, then, can speak on moral issues? Certainly not the engineers.
<br>
Ellen Ullman, a former computer programmer and the author of the 1997 book
<br>
&quot;Close to the Machine: Technology and Its Discontents,&quot; says that &quot;the
<br>
problem is not the technology, which in any event can't be stopped. The
<br>
problem is that engineers are making decisions for the rest of us.&quot;
<br>
Programmers are hired guns, she says, and rarely understand in a nuanced way
<br>
their clients' actual work. They are, she says, the last people &quot;to
<br>
understand what is an acceptable risk.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will be the great decision of the next decade. It goes well
<br>
beyond the mere commercial viability of new technologies, though many will
<br>
think that is all we need to know. It goes to who we think we are. One way:
<br>
every possibility is welcome, no matter how dangerous, because we are a
<br>
species that loves knowledge. The other: we don't want to be overcome by
<br>
technology.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that's what it means to be human. You have a choice. Take your
<br>
pick.
