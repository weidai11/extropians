<p>Josh, I think it's primarily a matter of speaking/writing as clearly and
<br>
entertainingly as possible, without dumbing down so far that the content is
<br>
abused. But the fundamental cultural problem is deeper and more wounding
<br>
than the need for simplified Asimovian storytelling. I don't know if what
<br>
follows helps in isolation from the rest of my argument (in the book THE
<br>
ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL), but I throw it in here for what it's worth, even
<br>
though it's pitched at a trained audience. Unfortunately, the indents and
<br>
other formats are lost in email:
<br>
<p>===================================
<br>
<p>Despite superb attempts by specialists such as Paul Davies and John Gribbin
<br>
to turn chaos and quantum theory, cosmology, genetics and ecology into
<br>
popular readable form, the strict working discourses of the sciences are
<br>
quite simply incommunicable to the non-initiate. Today's poetry might be
<br>
hard to understand (though not, surely, as thorny as the most formidable
<br>
literary criticism), but harder still is real cutting-edge science. The
<br>
reason is sketched by Kuhn: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most esoteric of poets. . . is far more concerned than the scientist
<br>
with lay approbation of his creative work, though he may be even less
<br>
concerned with approbation in general. That difference proves
<br>
consequential. Just because he is working only for an audience of
<br>
colleagues, an audience that shares his own values and beliefs, the
<br>
scientist can take a single set of standards for granted. (Kuhn:164)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in essays at popularisation, science rapidly evades the untrained
<br>
understanding. The non-specialist is unlikely to relish the following
<br>
passage, I think, any more than the average mathematician would enjoy a
<br>
paragraph from Derrida--yet Philip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh's The
<br>
Mathematical Experience is meant to be a popularisation! 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the nonstandard universe is conceptually distinct from the
<br>
standard one, it is desirable to think of it as an enlargement of the
<br>
standard universe. Since R* is a model for [the formal language] L, every
<br>
true sentence about R has an interpretation in R*. . . .	
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An object in R* (a pseudoreal number) is called infinite if it is
<br>
pseudogreater than every standard real number; otherwise it is called
<br>
finite. . . . If the pseudodifference of two pseudoreals is finite, we say
<br>
they belong to the same `galaxy'; the pseudoreal axis contains an
<br>
uncountable infinity of galaxies. If the pseudodifference of two
<br>
pseudoreals is infinitesimal, we say they belong to the same `monad'. . . .
<br>
The notion of a monad turns out to be applicable not only to real numbers
<br>
but also to general metric and topological space. Nonstandard analysis
<br>
therefore is relevant not just to elementary calculus but to the entire
<br>
range of modern abstract analysis. (Davis and Hersh, 1981:251-2)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I playing fair here? Perhaps that book is not truly a popularisation.
<br>
Perhaps its market is really those readers who once did quite a lot of
<br>
mathematics but have let its finer details slip from memory. Well, then,
<br>
consider the following instance, drawn from a tribute in Scientific
<br>
American to the late Richard Feynman:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Feynman's] lecture is a tour de force of exposition, seeking to derive a
<br>
couple of the most important results of quantum field theory not `in the
<br>
spirit of Dirac with lots of symbols and operators' but by explicit
<br>
arguments that flow from those summary zigzag sketches known everywhere as
<br>
Feynman diagrams. True to his way Feynman explains that he will set out
<br>
some `very simple examples. . . because if you do you will understand the
<br>
generalities at once--that's the way I understand these things anyhow'
<br>
(`Science and the Citizen', 1988:25. Author's ellipses.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it true that the `summary zigzag sketches' are known everywhere?
<br>
Hardly. The terms `DNA', `entropy' and `chaos', and a little of their
<br>
denotations, might have become educated commonplaces in the last two
<br>
decades, alongside certain computer terms, but knowledge of Feynman
<br>
diagrams is perhaps largely restricted to those non-scientists with a taste
<br>
for high-energy mysticism (e.g. Zukav, 1979:233-61) and the comparatively
<br>
few readers of journals such as Scientific American. The interesting step,
<br>
however, follows in this `popularisation':
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The diagrams are a form of shorthand analysis, but they are far from a
<br>
geometrization of the events. Their fidelity relies on careful and original
<br>
mathematical rules that accompany each straight or wiggly line, usually
<br>
generating at every vertex an exercise in matrix algebra; between
<br>
intersections they imply a clever nesting of integrals that serve to sum
<br>
over the spacetime excursions that intervene. (Idem)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feynman's sorrowing colleague is not being sardonic here, of all places,
<br>
at the expense of his non-specialist readers. Nevertheless, the deployment
<br>
of this precise (though highly general) account of Feynman's achievement
<br>
takes on the aspect, to the lay reader, of liturgy: of grand rhetoric,
<br>
poetic because we trust--on faith--its puissance to the initiate.
<br>
Otherwise, it is sheer mumbo-jumbo. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once made this comment to a science journalist, and she was mightily
<br>
offended. Feynman's theories on quantum electrodynamics (QED for short)
<br>
were by no means impossible for the general reader to understand, she told
<br>
me--for the unusual reason that Feynman himself wrote one of the greatest
<br>
science popularisations on that very topic. His book, based on a series of
<br>
lectures for a lay audience, is called QED (Feynman, 1990), a neat little
<br>
joke in itself. (For those who have forgotten their geometry lessons,
<br>
Q.E.D. also stands for quod erat demonstrandum, the phrase used to sum up a
<br>
demonstration.) It is lively, avoids pomposity and tricks of higher
<br>
mathematics--and, in my view, is really a snow job. I do not think it
<br>
explains those wiggly lines at all. It tries very hard, but in the end its
<br>
readers will carry off nothing but a blurry sense of a wonderful truth
<br>
forever out of focus.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel confident about this, because Feynman himself was honest enough to
<br>
admit it in the book. `The. . . reason that you might think you do not
<br>
understand what I am telling you is, while I am describing how Nature
<br>
works, you won't understand why Nature works that way. But you see, nobody
<br>
understands that' (ibid.:10). True, this is a subtle distinction. Perhaps
<br>
the how can be conveyed, even if the why is forever out of bounds. Not so;
<br>
in another typical friendly joke, the great physicist opened his third
<br>
lecture this way:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you haven't heard the other two lectures and will find this
<br>
lecture almost incomprehensible. Those of you who have heard the other two
<br>
lectures will also find this lecture incomprehensible, but you know that
<br>
that's all right: as I explained in the first lecture, the way we have to
<br>
describe Nature is generally incomprehensible to us. (ibid.:77)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, perhaps this is still just a humble acknowledgment that our poor
<br>
human minds can never hope to plumb the cosmos to its bottommost depths.
<br>
When we get into Feynman's own special mastery, though, he is forced to
<br>
shrug his shoulders in despair:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second action fundamental to quantum electrodynamics is: An electron
<br>
goes from point A to point B in space-time. . . . The formula for the
<br>
amplitude of this action. . . is a rather complicated formula, and I'm
<br>
sorry that I don't know how to explain it in simple terms. (ibid.:90-1)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to get into the amplitude of quantum least-action paths to
<br>
get lost. What can the curious onlooker from the humanities make of a
<br>
General Motors advertisement in the front of the same issue of Scientific
<br>
American that carried Feynman's obit? (Remember, what follows is from a
<br>
paid advertisement in a popular magazine!) Expensive, handsomely mounted
<br>
over three pages of colour for its impact on sales and perhaps staff
<br>
recruitment, the ad describes research into robotic arm control. It is
<br>
worth citing about a fifth of the text, for the accumulating impact it
<br>
achieves on the dazed, utterly excluded humanities reader:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem could be discretized, making it in some sense finite, it
<br>
could be put on a computer and solved numerically. So Dr. Marin replaced
<br>
the unknown function with a piecewise cubic approximation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allows the search for the unknown function to be confined to a class
<br>
of functions that are completely characterized by a finite number of
<br>
coefficients in a B-spline series.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He similarly discretized the constraints, replacing the infinite set of
<br>
constraints with a finite dimensional subset that could be dealt with
<br>
numerically.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He completed the formulation of the discrete problem by incorporating a
<br>
grid-refinement strategy. Now the problem's dimension could be gradually
<br>
increased to better approximate the continuous case.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What resulted was a classic non-linear optimization problem, a finite
<br>
dimensional problem in which it remained only to find the coefficients of
<br>
the B-splines while satisfying the constraints.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A monotonicity property of this problem coupled with properties of the
<br>
approximation method suggests that the simple technique of cyclic
<br>
coordinate descent might best provide a solution. (Scientific American,
<br>
June, 1988:17)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shape of the language is cheerful journalese. It goes on at once to
<br>
quote from Dr Marin, and ends with biographical notes (`Sam is a Member of
<br>
the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. He lives in Rochester
<br>
Hills, Michigan, with his wife and two children.'). Nor is it difficult to
<br>
decode the general sense of the text. It is hardly more technically obtuse,
<br>
on the face of it, than any carpenters' guide to fixing the rafters, which
<br>
is also a complex discourse laden with specialised terms that exclude the
<br>
outsider but make for precision and speed among practitioners. The problem
<br>
is, however, one of kind, and not of degree. Consulting a dictionary may
<br>
provide definitions of `monotonicity' but this will be hardly enough to
<br>
make it operational. The Britannica explains without enlightenment that
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In problems in which the approximate has to match f(x) but not Df(x),
<br>
D^2f(x), etc., it is undesirable to introduce derivatives of f(x) as
<br>
additional parameters (arbitrary constants). Consequently, a desirable
<br>
property in piecewise functions might be continuity of the derivatives at
<br>
the nodes without specifying the values of the derivatives there. Piecewise
<br>
approximates of this type are known as splines, the most popular form of
<br>
which is the cubic spline. (Encyclopedia Britannica, Vol. 25:43)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Elucidation' of this order points to an exclusion principle at work: the
<br>
two cultures remain sundered.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, we might consider a fragment from Wallace Stevens, premier
<br>
poetic object of American deconstructive analysis (cited and discussed in
<br>
Paulson, 1988:102):
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell X that speech is not dirty silence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clarified. It is silence made still dirtier. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This takes the form of an injunctive proposition. It looks like a
<br>
philosophical assertion rendered rhetorically for greater bite. It might
<br>
even be supposed to enact itself, for it is at the least emulated speech
<br>
made dirtier, in the sense of more opaque, quarrelsome, difficult. Less
<br>
translucently, it might infold or hide profound intertextual nuance and
<br>
ambience. Perhaps to take its measure fully one needs to be acquainted with
<br>
all Stevens' work, with that of his contemporary poets and perhaps
<br>
philosophers, and with the cultural matrix out of which his reading and
<br>
writing was ushered. Charles Bazerman makes this point in an
<br>
interdisciplinary examination of `what written knowledge does', though he
<br>
is dealing chiefly with critical discourse in literature and `first order'
<br>
discourse in science. Of the former he observes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literary vocabulary on one level appears to be purely technical, not
<br>
unlike the technical vocabularies of molecular biology or sociology. Terms
<br>
such as topos, apostrophe, sonnet, turn, enjambment and sublime are the
<br>
critic's basic conceptual equipment, learned as part of professional
<br>
training. On another level, however, the literary terms are more than
<br>
technical, for each reverberates with former uses and examples. One can
<br>
know and understand deoxyribose on the basis of modern chemistry alone, but
<br>
to understand the sublime one must not only have read Longinus and be
<br>
familiar with the ensuing critical debate to modern times, one must have
<br>
experienced a wide range of poems that embody the development and variation
<br>
of that concept. (Bazerman, 1981:376)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, surely the lay reader of literature (and even of much criticism)
<br>
has a grasp of its meaning which vanishes when faced with B-splines and
<br>
cyclic coordinate descent-based algorithms. The paradoxical outcome of this
<br>
fact is drawn by William Paulson, who cited the Stevens poem in
<br>
exemplification of a rueful remark by the great physicist Paul Dirac, `In
<br>
physics, we try to say things that no one knew before in a way that
<br>
everyone can understand, whereas in poetry. . .' (cited in Paulson,
<br>
1988:101). While it might not be true that in poetry the everyday is
<br>
rendered as obscurely as possible (is it really mere common-sense that
<br>
speech is cleaned-up noise?), a cultivation of plurivocity, aporia and
<br>
level-shifts of meaning is patently and typically signalled by Stevens in a
<br>
way absolutely unlike the attempt on precise disambiguation in the GM
<br>
advertisement and the Feynman obit. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the poet dirties the windowpanes of silence and speech alike, it is `to
<br>
make the visible a little hard/ To see' (idem): to interrupt utility in the
<br>
interests of insight--even if that insight is always-already `blind', as
<br>
the late American deconstructor Paul de Man would have it (de Man, 1971).
<br>
Paradigm challenge, on a microlevel, is being raised to a principle of
<br>
studied textual generation. But note that this claim of mine itself
<br>
partakes of both methods, aiming at explanation while unashamedly
<br>
`bisociating' two meanings of paradigm: the Kuhnian, where the word means
<br>
an exemplary model practice, and the literary, where it means a list of
<br>
synonyms. We cannot easily, if at all, dispel ambiguity from discourse.
<br>
<p>Signals out of Noise
<br>
<p>I began with the sociological observation that if any unified culture had
<br>
ever existed it is now lost to us. With very rare exceptions, trained minds
<br>
and sensibilities within the western episteme may be cultivated in an
<br>
artistic or a scientific mode but not both. Snow's aperçu captured this
<br>
truth of the industrial and postindustrial condition with journalistic
<br>
vividness, simplifying the great grinding tectonics of history, politics,
<br>
knowledge-constitution, power into a slogan: `the two cultures'.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has never approached adequacy as an analytic account, nor, I think, was
<br>
it so intended. Snow meant his rude outburst to shake a complacent
<br>
establishment into heeding the advice of those `men of affairs' whose
<br>
scientific specialties lent them a privileged access to the world's
<br>
abundant human miseries, and to a historically new class of actual or
<br>
potential remedies for those disorders. Today we more easily read his
<br>
slogan in terms of competing discourses. Not just two, of course, for
<br>
discursive theorists have shown us how multiple and proliferative these
<br>
communicative practices are. Still, for polemical purposes two might be
<br>
after all the optimum categorial number. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cliche runs on ahead of any discussion. The humanities and the sciences:
<br>
the poetic, subjective utterance of the creating artist, versus the
<br>
stringent, objective notation of the observing scientist. Neither summary,
<br>
as we have seen, is remotely competent, yet both retain a powerful hold on
<br>
the imagination of our epoch. This is no accident, nor is it purely a
<br>
function of ideology. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical theory at the end of the millennium embraces aporia and rupture.
<br>
Is it, then, deeply wrong-headed even to ask whether some alternative
<br>
discourse might be able to bridge these two isolated empires? Whether it is
<br>
speculative narrative, postmodern collage, the postfuturist sublime or some
<br>
other candidate, perhaps the enterprise is intrinsically misconceived?
<br>
Perhaps what Snow witnessed was no less than the first unmistakable rumble
<br>
of what would become a tumultuous geyser as the stressed epistemic systems
<br>
buckled, tore asunder, burst open under contradiction like some allegory of
<br>
dialectics. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But perhaps this account is too apocalyptic by half. Even if it is the
<br>
case that our episteme is undergoing crisis (assuming that all the
<br>
multitudes of vectors in a culture can be summed into a single arrow), we
<br>
have no warrant either to wring our hands or to rejoice at this complex
<br>
fact. All that can be said with certainty, perhaps, is that our language is
<br>
always-already inadequate to inscribe prescriptions or memorials on such a
<br>
grand scale. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no outside-the-text, because everything which a multi-levelled
<br>
subjectivity uses to turn graphemes into meaning is `inscribed' in some
<br>
text or other, some semiotic system. Even our apparently direct access to
<br>
the world arrives through narrow sensory codes and channels and vast
<br>
quantities of neural pre-processing. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no inside-the-text, because a text is just an array of abandoned
<br>
lexemes until it is activated by semiotic systems of textual codes, frames
<br>
and encyclopaedias operating inside and around its readers. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literary theorist Douwe Fokkema, as we have seen, posits three textual
<br>
supercodes: the syntactic, the semantic, and the pragmatic. Any literary
<br>
act of writing or reading, on this analysis, invokes other subsidiary
<br>
codes, such as the group- or period-codes which constitute and signal one
<br>
level of inscription and reception. But so too does any scientific act of
<br>
notation, computation, reportage, propaganda, textbook dissemination of the
<br>
canonical and the paradigmatic. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written communication is hardly all there is to scientific discourse,
<br>
despite Latour's emphasis on inscription, for much of science is conducted
<br>
by tacit means. Through apprenticeship, techniques and protocols of
<br>
interaction are learned and transmitted by non-formal and non-textual means
<br>
(unless `textual' means, vacuously, everything). Nor is textuality
<br>
everything in painting, music, sculpture, acting, film-making, or perhaps
<br>
even writing and speaking poetry and prose. Language is the chief part of
<br>
what we can pin down and analyse in these practices. What most strikingly
<br>
segregates the literary and the scientific communities is their separate
<br>
patterns and approved protocols of discourse, of communication and
<br>
publication. Still, we must not forget, as a cognitive philosopher reminds
<br>
us, that there is `something important missing from the sociological
<br>
account. That something is. . . causal interaction between scientists and
<br>
the world' (Giere, 1988:4). Charles Bazerman expresses well the crux of
<br>
this impasse:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current inability to forge a convincing link between the socially
<br>
constructivist critique of scientific formulations and the empirical
<br>
project has roots in how we have become accustomed to think about language
<br>
in this century. When socially minded observers of scientific activity come
<br>
to think about the role of language, our current concepts of language offer
<br>
no strong clues about how language talks about anything other than itself.
<br>
. . .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[D]ebate over how to talk about one's subject continues in all
<br>
disciplines today, and cannot be separated from the fundamental practices
<br>
of those disciplines. [. . .I]n those communal endeavors whose goal is
<br>
symbolic knowledge, the more we understand the way symbols are used in the
<br>
activity, the better we can carry out that activity. (Bazerman, 1988:295, 317)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, it is certainly not aporia and paradox versus precision
<br>
and univocity that serve to distinguish the humanities from the sciences.
<br>
As we have seen, both hegemonic systems engage regularity and discontinuity
<br>
by turns. This is why Jean-François Lyotard stresses the importance in
<br>
science, as in the arts, of paralogy: of what appear to be errors or wrong
<br>
moves in a given game, but prove to be superior moves (or at least to have
<br>
the possibility of being so) in a slightly or a drastically new game
<br>
(Lyotard, 1984).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend, an `epistemological anarchist',
<br>
has argued that science and the humanities pursue very much the same mixed
<br>
strategies and tactics. A scientist, for example,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;starts with a bulk of material consisting of diverse and conflicting
<br>
ingredients. There are theories formulated in accordance with the highest
<br>
standards of rigour and precision side by side with unfounded and sloppy
<br>
approximations, there are `solid' facts, local laws based on some of these
<br>
facts, there are heuristic principles, tentative formulations of new points
<br>
of view which partly agree, partly conflict with the accepted facts, there
<br>
are vague philosophical ideas, standards of rationality and procedures that
<br>
conflict with these. Being unable to make such material conform to simple
<br>
views of order and consistency the scientist usually develops a practical
<br>
logic that permits him to get results amidst chaos and incoherence
<br>
(Feyerabend, 1978:199).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Paulson has urged a similar view--abhorrent to traditionalists in
<br>
either culture--with force and zest. In the light of our current
<br>
understanding, he notes, it is reasonable to seek in literary studies (and,
<br>
one might add, paraliterary and scientific studies)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not pure knowledge, not a means of dishing out common cultural fare to
<br>
the many, but a part of the process wherein new concepts, practices, and
<br>
symbolic moves are invented and propagated. . . .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature is the noise of culture, the rich and indeterminate margin
<br>
into which messages are sent off, never to return the same, in which
<br>
signals are received not quite like anything emitted. (Paulson, 1988:180)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frame for Paulson's startling argument is the place we started our
<br>
discussion: information theory understood within a model of life and
<br>
culture as self-organising, creating their own stability and complexity in
<br>
the face of entropy, a picture based on Prigogine's controversial theory of
<br>
thermodynamics far-from-equilibrium (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984; Waldrop,
<br>
1993; Lewin, 1993). Noise is not necessarily just a `parasite' (as the
<br>
French call it, in an untranslatable pun). It can be novel information that
<br>
requires a new frame of reference for its reception. It can be an
<br>
unsettling input into a tired old system from one or more alternative
<br>
structures. Whether smuggled or welcomed into that system, redefining it,
<br>
such novelties can renew and extend its possible moves in the world--can
<br>
renew even its self-understanding. Paulson notes:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature is a discursive form and an archive that is out of step with
<br>
technocratic modernity. It cannot therefore supply that modernity and its
<br>
political institutions with reassuring narratives or metanarratives to live
<br>
by; it can only perturb them as a kind of noise. Yet it is only because of
<br>
internal perturbation, whether arising from memory or from the plurality of
<br>
cognitive and discursive strategies, that we can be observers of ourselves.
<br>
. . . Internal noise, in other words, keeps us from being so fully
<br>
integrated into a silently functioning system that we would cease to be
<br>
aware of it as system. (Paulson:181)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But while this is true of canonised literature, alternative textualities
<br>
such as postmodern, post-colonial and other marginalised narratives might
<br>
have a larger role still. Unlike authorised literature, these texts
<br>
sometimes have the capacity to grind noise and grit into the
<br>
meta-narratives which ideology remorselessly drones through our eyes, ears
<br>
and bodies. By a curious reversal, they constitute a discursive form and an
<br>
archive which is not always out of step with technocratic modernity or
<br>
postmodernity. True, this might make such textuality easily co-optable to
<br>
the work of suasion; the postmodern workplace, including the new virtual
<br>
reality cyberspace, is more often decorative than challenging (Benedikt,
<br>
1991; Rheingold, 1991; Ross, 1991). Yet it offers as well an enhanced
<br>
access to Paulson's fecund noise. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most of this century, since the triumphant merger between genetics and
<br>
Darwinism, we have known beyond doubt that animals, plants and microbes are
<br>
machines for understanding the world. Calling living creatures `machines'
<br>
still disturbs many people, because traditionally machines are instruments
<br>
made by humans for human purposes. The natural world is not a table set for
<br>
our hungry and feckless consumption. Agreed; but on this scientific account
<br>
we, too, are machines--wonderful, non-linear machines with feelings,
<br>
aspirations, duties and a hunger to know and do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans, like all organic machines, have been shaped by evolution to deal
<br>
with their environment, and our principal environment is other human
<br>
beings. So we have specialised in comprehending one another: face to face,
<br>
in groups, through all the media of discourse (Schank and Abelson, 1977).
<br>
Most of the time our brains are dedicated to constructing stories about
<br>
people. The human brain/mind is primarily a hermeneutic device tailored for
<br>
interpreting the actions and motives of others.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emulating the messy, vastly cross-linked neural architecture of the brain,
<br>
distributed parallel-processing computers are now starting to model how we
<br>
can understand, intend and act almost instantly in a complicated world
<br>
(Tank and Hopfield, 1987:62-70). If people make plentiful mistakes of
<br>
interpretation, that is the price we pay for functioning in a real world
<br>
indefinitely more complex and noisy than the awful neatness of the
<br>
traditionally scientific linear programs driving orthodox computers. Minds
<br>
are `knowledge systems', not `logic systems', operating what Jeremy
<br>
Campbell has dubbed, in a memorable phrase, the worldly brain (Campbell,
<br>
1989). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a computer needs to be told by an explicit algorithm to go to a
<br>
specific `address', a pigeon-hole in memory that might contain anything, a
<br>
human mind reaches directly for a desired `content'. This information
<br>
(including codes for feelings, wishes and the rest of what makes us human)
<br>
is dispersed throughout the brain, each location linked to others by
<br>
networks of affinities. One idea usually leads to another via schemata,
<br>
standardised stories we tell ourselves about how our world works. And in
<br>
most cases, what we need to know about that world is how other people
<br>
think, feel, expect and mean to act. The arts and humanities, one might
<br>
say, are the first archive and continuing matrix of practices born from the
<br>
evolved machinery which defines us as Homo sapiens sapiens.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The human world that our worldly brain is dedicated to understanding is,
<br>
then, in a profound sense far more complicated than the world at large,
<br>
which is why science is paradoxically so simple. The practice of science is
<br>
obscure because it manipulates esoteric but starkly elementary models very
<br>
removed from the domain we inhabit (even though its results are absolutely
<br>
pertinent to everyday life). `The kind of beauty we find in physical
<br>
theories,' notes Steven Weinberg, 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is of a very limited sort. It is. . . the beauty of simplicity and
<br>
inevitability. . . Shakespeare's plays. . . are big messy compositions
<br>
whose messiness mirrors the complexity of life. That is part of the beauty
<br>
of his plays, a beauty that to my taste is of a higher order than the
<br>
beauty of. . . general relativity' (Weinberg, 1993:119)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One surprising consequence of such demythologised accounts is a
<br>
realisation that both great systems of discourse, despite Weinberg's
<br>
gallant bow of deference to Shakespeare, have a lot in common. For many
<br>
scientific researchers hard at work decoding the objective world,
<br>
Feyerabend reminds us,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metaphysical principles are used to advance research, logical laws and
<br>
methodological standards are suspended without much ado as constituting
<br>
undue restrictions, adventurous and `irrational' conceptions abound. The
<br>
successful researcher frequently is a literate man, he knows many tricks,
<br>
ideas, ways of speaking, he is familiar with details of history and
<br>
abstractions of cosmology, he can combine fragments of widely differing
<br>
points of view and quickly switch from one framework to another. He is not
<br>
tied to any particular language for he may speak the language of fact and
<br>
the language of fairytale side by side and mix them up in the most
<br>
unexpected ways. (Feyerabend, 1978:200)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it is in this odd but charming rapprochement that serious inquiry
<br>
into the sciences and humanities must finally discover itself: in the
<br>
underdetermination of all theory, evaded by the defiantly or unknown
<br>
uninscribable, and in its overdetermination by a multitude of factors
<br>
beyond computable assay; in the discourses of a worldly brain dedicated to
<br>
the understanding of others like itself, yet dwelling in a world rebuilt by
<br>
its own ingenuity. For that very reason--the ubiquity and at last the
<br>
banality of the radical `incompletability' of knowledge--one is obliged
<br>
(like every scientist, like every poet) to continue dipping the sea with a
<br>
sieve.
