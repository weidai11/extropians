<br>
Gifted Children: Myths and Realities
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>The term &quot;gifted&quot; is emotionally loaded. Throughout history, genius
<br>
has often been seen as one aspect of insanity. Aristotle's
<br>
observation &quot;There was never a great genius without a tincture of
<br>
madness&quot; continues to be believed as common folklore.
<br>
<p>People also tend to believe that intellectualism and practicality are
<br>
incompatible. It is expressed in such sayings as &quot;He (or she) is too
<br>
smart for his (her) own good&quot; or &quot;It's not smart to be too smart.&quot;
<br>
High intelligence is often assumed to be incompatible with happiness.
<br>
<p>Gifted children too have inspired fascination and awe, as well as
<br>
intimidation and envy. They have been rejected as nerds. Their
<br>
parents have been derided as zealots who live through their children
<br>
and deprive them of their childhood.
<br>
<p>Our schools have often been criticized for refusing to modify the
<br>
curriculum for the gifted, or for pulling the smart kids in from
<br>
other schools in order to fill a gifted program. Despite lip service
<br>
paid to the gifted our society ignores the problem of how to identify
<br>
and nurture children with exceptional abilities.
<br>
<p>In her new book &quot;Gifted Children: Myths and Realities,&quot; Boston
<br>
College psychologist Ellen Winner examines the issues associated with
<br>
gifted children. In the book Winner explores the myths about
<br>
giftedness and shows us what these children are really like.

<br>
<p>Tischler: How did you become interested in the topic of gifted children?
<br>
<p><p><p>Winner: I am a developmental psychologist, so I am interested in
<br>
normal development. I also have been particularly interested in
<br>
artistic development, and as soon as you are interested in artistic
<br>
and musical children you are exposed to issues of extreme ability and
<br>
talent.
<br>
<p>I also became interested in this topic because psychologists seem to
<br>
know a good deal more about the negative aspects of development than
<br>
the positive. We know a lot more about retardation than we do about
<br>
giftedness. So I felt there was much research that needed to be done.
<br>
<p>Tischler: I have often noticed a level of hostility and resentment
<br>
toward programs for the gifted. Why is that the case?
<br>
<p><p>Winner: I think that they are threatening. I think people feel
<br>
envious also. There is also an anti-elitism strain and an
<br>
anti--intellectualism strain. It's interesting, because I don't think
<br>
that we feel as hostile towards children who are artistically or
<br>
musically gifted or athletically talented. We are perfectly willing
<br>
to accept that there are children at the high end in those areas. We
<br>
know that these children get extra and special lessons after school.
<br>
The academically gifted, however, seem to bother people. If there are
<br>
certain children who are the academic elite, it means there are
<br>
others who are not, and people do not want to think that.
<br>
<p>Tischler: In your book you mention several traits that are associated
<br>
with gifted children. What are these traits?
<br>
<p><p>Winner: I talk about three traits. The first is precocity. These
<br>
children are extremely precocious. They do things years ahead of
<br>
their peers. For example, in the academic area they may start to read
<br>
at age two or three. They will talk early. One gifted child started
<br>
to talk before he was six months old. He was reading before he was
<br>
twelve months old. That was the most extreme case, a child named
<br>
Michael Carney, who has been in the news often. He was the youngest
<br>
college graduate ever, graduating at age ten.
<br>
<p>A second characteristic is what I call a rage to master. Gifted
<br>
children are internally driven. They are driven to master their area
<br>
of talent. You don't need to push these children. They are pushing
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>The third characteristic is that these children march to their own
<br>
drummer. They are not just faster, they are also different. One way
<br>
that they are different is that they are extremely independent. They
<br>
need almost no adult support in order to master their domain. In
<br>
fact, they are often resistant to adult interference. They are also
<br>
different in that they seem to solve problems in unusual ways. They
<br>
don't just solve problems faster, but they come up with intuitive and
<br>
creative solutions.
<br>
<p>Tischler: Is there a difference between the academically gifted and
<br>
the aesthetically gifted?
<br>
<p><p>Winner: In my book I talk about academic, musical, and artistic
<br>
giftedness. In the academic area I distinguish between math and
<br>
linguistic abilities. I think each of these areas has its own
<br>
developmental history, its own early signs, and needs to be
<br>
considered separately. The art and music children have all three of
<br>
the criteria for giftedness that I just mentioned.
<br>
<p>I think it is a mistake to differentiate too strongly between the
<br>
aesthetically gifted and the academically gifted. We tend to call
<br>
academically gifted children &quot;gifted,&quot; and musically and artistically
<br>
gifted &quot;talented.&quot; We imply that there is some qualitative difference
<br>
between these two classes of children. I don't think they are
<br>
qualitatively different except for the domain in which they have
<br>
their talent. The musically and artistically talented are also
<br>
extremely precocious, they have this rage to master and they also
<br>
march to their own drummer.
<br>
<p>Tischler: You also take issue with the statement that many teachers
<br>
make that all children are gifted and they all have talents that just
<br>
need to be nurtured and developed.
<br>
<p>Winner: About twenty years the view was that no children were gifted.
<br>
Today the politically correct thing to say is that all children are
<br>
gifted. It also means that we do not need to do anything for these
<br>
children, because there are no special children and every child has a
<br>
gift. Of course every child has relative strengths and weaknesses,
<br>
but that is not the same as saying that every child has an extreme
<br>
area of ability. In my book I am talking about children who are
<br>
extremely gifted. It is certainly not the case that all children are
<br>
extremely gifted.
<br>
<p>Tischler: How extensive are the programs for the gifted?
<br>
<p><p>Winner: We really don't do that much, and it is particularly a
<br>
problem during the elementary school years. The most common form of
<br>
program for the gifted is an enrichment or pull-out program. That
<br>
means that the child is taken out of the classroom once or twice a
<br>
week for a forty minute session of a class that, it might involve
<br>
field trips, creative problem solving, projects, and just about
<br>
anything. These programs are not geared to any particular area of
<br>
giftedness and the way to get into these programs is to score 130 on
<br>
an IQ test or by a teacher recommendation. This means that these
<br>
programs are mostly populated by what I call moderately gifted
<br>
children, and they are in there with the extremely gifted. These are
<br>
minimal solutions to big problems. These kids then go back to the
<br>
regular classroom and are asked to spend the rest of the week
<br>
learning at a level for which they are much too advanced.
<br>
<p>Parents of extremely gifted children need to find a school that is
<br>
specially set up for these children. If that is not possible, I would
<br>
recommend some moderate grade skipping, possibly one or two years. I
<br>
would also recommend a school that allows the child to advance at his
<br>
or her own pace. That might be the only solution parents can find
<br>
today.

<br>
Jan 13th 2001
<br>
&nbsp;From The Economist print edition
<br>
Psychologists are divided over whether genius is innate or acquired.
<br>
Nobody has yet been smart enough to figure it out
<br>
<p>THOMAS EDISON gave his famous formula for genius as 1% inspiration
<br>
and 99% perspiration. Modern-day students of geniuses and prodigies,
<br>
though, argue over the relative contributions of more tangible
<br>
factors-of genetics, of physiology, of hours spent in training. Most
<br>
believe that geniuses have special genes. Almost nobody takes the
<br>
opposite stance: that prodigy performance, in any field, lies within
<br>
the grasp of anyone who cares to try hard enough.
<br>
<p>Anders Ericsson, a psychologist at Florida State University, falls
<br>
into the minority camp. Given ten years of deliberate practice, Dr
<br>
Ericsson says, anyone should be able to attain prodigy-level
<br>
performance in his discipline of choice. The intuitive objection to
<br>
this idea is the &quot;Mozart argument&quot;, as it is called by Brian
<br>
Butterworth, a neuroscientist at University College London who has
<br>
studied the psychological aspects of arithmetic for many years. This
<br>
argument is that not everyone can become a Mozart merely by dint of
<br>
hard work. Dr Ericsson wonders why not. After all, he argues, did not
<br>
Mozart become Mozart by dint of hard work?
<br>
<p>This may seem to be easily refuted by popular legends about geniuses
<br>
such as Mozart, Paganini and Gauss, which report that they all showed
<br>
exceptional skills in early childhood before receiving a shred of
<br>
formal instruction. But Dr Ericsson points out that most of these
<br>
stories are, indeed, legends. Rather than rely on such myths, he
<br>
insists on studying those experts and prodigies who are living today.
<br>
Practice makes perfect
<br>
<p>Dr Ericsson does not believe that the exceptional abilities of such
<br>
people are due to their innate talent. Rather, he explains their
<br>
performance by pointing out that they have developed powerful
<br>
memories for storing information about particular topics.
<br>
Psychologists recognise (and brain-science confirms) a distinction
<br>
between short-term &quot;working&quot; memory and long-term memory. Dr Ericsson
<br>
believes that prodigies get such impressive mileage out of their
<br>
working memories by placing important pieces of information into
<br>
their long-term memories in a way that makes them accessible to
<br>
working-memory processes. According to Dr Ericsson, this &quot;long-term
<br>
working memory&quot; is the essential ingredient for expert performance in
<br>
any field, from chess to typing to golf, and can be developed at will.
<br>
<p>Recently, some neuroscientists tried to observe long-term working
<br>
memory in action. Nathalie Tzourio-Mazoyer at the University of Caen,
<br>
in France, and her colleagues, measured the brain activity of a maths
<br>
prodigy as he performed some feats of arithmetical acrobatics. Their
<br>
subject, Rüdiger Gamm, can calculate the fifth root of a ten-digit
<br>
numeral within seconds, and as quickly raise a two-digit number to
<br>
its ninth power. When asked to divide one integer by another, he
<br>
unhesitatingly recites the answer to 60 decimal places. Dr
<br>
Tzourio-Mazoyer's research, published in this month's Nature
<br>
Neuroscience, represents one of the first efforts to watch such a
<br>
performance as it unfolds in the brain.
<br>
<p>Through the use of positron-emission tomography (PET), an imaging
<br>
technique, Dr Tzourio-Mazoyer's team found that Mr Gamm was using
<br>
more of his brain than normal controls, with whom they compared him,
<br>
as he performed his mathematical tricks. Both Mr Gamm and the
<br>
controls showed activity in 12 parts of the brain, but in five
<br>
additional areas, Mr Gamm alone showed any activity. Three of these
<br>
areas have previously been linked with the formation of episodic
<br>
memories, which are a kind of long-term memory.
<br>
<p>Mr Gamm appeared to be using his long-term memory to store the
<br>
working results that he needed to complete his calculations-for
<br>
example, all the dividends and remainders of a division sum. His use
<br>
of this extra memory space meant that he could circumvent that
<br>
perennial pitfall of mental arithmetic, losing one's place. In other
<br>
respects, Mr Gamm's brain does not appear notably unusual. Nor does
<br>
he perform with exceptional aptitude on tests of skills that lie
<br>
outside his area of expertise, such as verbal recall. Moreover, Mr
<br>
Gamm, who is now 26, was not born with this computing ability. He
<br>
developed his skills, through four hours of practising memorisation
<br>
daily, only after he had passed the ripe old age of 20.
<br>
<p>As both the PET scan and his past experience bear out, enhanced
<br>
memory appears to be the key to Mr Gamm's ability. So this study
<br>
seems to provide some neurological evidence for Dr Ericsson's idea
<br>
that long-term working-memory function underpins prodigy-level
<br>
performance. So far, so plausible. But Dr Ericsson also maintains
<br>
that such memory function, and the superlative performance that goes
<br>
with it, can be attained by anyone-biology no bar-given enough
<br>
practice and perseverance.
<br>
<p>This is a much more contentious point. Twenty years ago, Dr Ericsson
<br>
tried to prove it by training some ordinary laboratory volunteers up
<br>
to prodigy-level performance in a number-memory task. Average people
<br>
tend to have a &quot;digit-span&quot; of seven-in other words they can recall a
<br>
string of seven random digits after hearing it read out once. But
<br>
after a year's practice, two of his particularly dedicated subjects
<br>
were able to increase their digit-spans to lengths of 80 and 100.
<br>
<p>Just as Dr Ericsson took people with no discernible talent and turned
<br>
them into champions, so, in a fashion, did a Hungarian, Laszlo
<br>
Polgar. When he began training his daughters, it was widely believed
<br>
that women could not play serious tournament chess. But through a
<br>
deliberate (and still continuing) psychological experiment, Dr Polgar
<br>
and his wife created a trio of world-class chess champions out of
<br>
their own daughters, overturning this prejudice.
<br>
<p>By 1992, all three had reached the women's top ten worldwide. The
<br>
third, who presumably received the most refined training regimen,
<br>
became the youngest grandmaster in the history of the game and is
<br>
reckoned by her peers to have a good chance of becoming world
<br>
champion one day. With remarkable, if not hubristic, prescience, Dr
<br>
Polgar had written a detailed book on the subject of child rearing,
<br>
entitled &quot;Bring Up Genius!&quot; before beginning the coaching of his
<br>
children. But would any child reared by such a parent have become a
<br>
chess prodigy?
<br>
<p>Ellen Winner, a psychologist at Boston College who has been studying
<br>
the relationship between exposure to the arts and subsequent academic
<br>
achievement, believes not. She argues that only children with the
<br>
&quot;rage to master&quot; a skill could make it through the gruelling years of
<br>
training needed to achieve expert ability. The rage to master may be
<br>
the point at which nature unequivocally makes its constraints felt.
<br>
Even Dr Ericsson concedes that there might be a genetic component
<br>
separating the child willing to persevere with a rigorous schedule
<br>
from the child who would rather play videogames.
<br>
<p>Put it another way: even if there are no born mathematicians or
<br>
musicians, there may be &quot;born achievers&quot;. The particular area in
<br>
which such people make their mark might be determined purely by the
<br>
kind of environment or skill to which they were exposed and how hard
<br>
they then applied themselves. But among many psychologists this
<br>
all-purpose view of genius is not a popular one. Dean Simonton of the
<br>
University of California, San Diego, dubbed it the &quot;drudge theory&quot; of
<br>
genius in a recent book review.
<br>
<p>Dr Simonton considers genius to have more of a genetic component. Yet
<br>
this conviction has not stopped him from writing a book of profiles
<br>
of psychologists who were reckoned to be geniuses. The American
<br>
Psychological Association will publish this book later this year, so
<br>
that its members may learn from Dr Simonton's observations on the
<br>
great prodigies of psychology. And though Dr Ericsson is not on his
<br>
list this year, in ten years from now he doubtless will be-if he
<br>
wants it badly enough.
