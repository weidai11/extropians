COVER STORY
<br>
Designer People
<br>
<p>The Human Genetic Blueprint Has Been Drafted, Offering Both Perils and
<br>
Opportunities for the Environment. The Big Question: Are We Changing the
<br>
Nature of Nature?
<br>
<p>By Sally Deneen
<br>
<p>Princeton University microbiologist Lee M. Silver can see a day a few
<br>
centuries from now when there are two species of humans--the standard-issue
<br>
&quot;Naturals,&quot; and the &quot;Gene-enriched,&quot; an elite class whose parents
<br>
consciously bought for them designer genes, and whose parents before them
<br>
did the same, and so on for generations. Want Billy to have superior
<br>
athletic ability? Plunk down the cash. Want Suzy to be exceptionally smart?
<br>
Just pull out the Visa card at your local fertility clinic, where the elite
<br>
likely will go to enhance their babies-to-be.
<br>
<p>It will start innocently enough: Birth defects that are caused by a single
<br>
gene, such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, will be targeted first,
<br>
and probably with little controversy. Then, as societal fears about messing
<br>
with Mother Nature subside, Silver and other researchers predict that a
<br>
genetic solution to preventing diabetes, heart disease and other big killers
<br>
will be found and offered. So will genetic inoculations against HIV.
<br>
Eventually, the mind will be targeted for improvement--preventing alcohol
<br>
addiction and mental illness, and enhancing visual acuity or intelligence to
<br>
try to produce the next Vincent Van Gogh or Albert Einstein. Even traits
<br>
from other animals may be added, such as a dog's sense of smell or an
<br>
eagle's eyesight.
<br>
<p>What parents would see as a simple, if pricey, way to improve their kids
<br>
would result, after many generations of gene selection, in a profound change
<br>
by the year 2400--humans would be two distinct species, related as humans
<br>
and chimps are today, and just as unable to interbreed. People now have 46
<br>
chromosomes; the gene-enriched would have 48 to accommodate added traits,
<br>
Silver predicts in his aptly titled book, Remaking Eden.
<br>
<p>We may already be on the path to change the very nature of nature. If you
<br>
think it's a far-off prospect best left to future generations, think again.
<br>
On June 26, 2000, with much fanfare, scientists with the taxpayer-supported
<br>
Human Genome Project (working with the private Celera Genomics of Rockville,
<br>
Maryland) announced that they had completed a working draft of a genetic
<br>
blueprint for a human being. Many details still need to be filled in before
<br>
scientists can build a human from scratch.
<br>
<p>Sequencing the human genome requires identifying 3.2 billion chemical
<br>
&quot;letters&quot; located on the 46 coiled strands of DNA found in nearly every
<br>
human cell. While researchers now know the order in which DNA is arranged on
<br>
the chromosomes, they haven't identified all those chemical &quot;letters,&quot; which
<br>
contain the instructions for making the proteins that comprise the human
<br>
body. About half of the genome sequence is in near-finished form or better;
<br>
a quarter is finished. The 15-year project is to be completed in 2005 at a
<br>
budgeted cost of $3 billion, though some of that tax money is spent on other
<br>
genomic research.
<br>
<p>While the implications for longevity, health insurance and discrimination of
<br>
this milestone achievement have grabbed media attention, the ramifications
<br>
for the environment--good and bad--haven't.
<br>
<p>An Accelerating Timetable
<br>
<p>How soon will all this happen? Silver believes that by around 2010 parents
<br>
will be able to genetically ensure their babies won't grow up to be fat or
<br>
alcoholic, and by 2050 arrange to insert an extra gene into single-cell
<br>
embryos within 24 hours of conception to make babies resistant to AIDS. It
<br>
is already possible to insert foreign DNA into mice, pigs and sheep. The
<br>
obstacles to inserting them in humans are mainly technical ones. At this
<br>
point in human knowledge, it could lead to mutations. Several techniques are
<br>
under development to try to avoid that, however.
<br>
<p>&quot;For the near and midterm future, we're looking at science fiction. You'd
<br>
have to be terminally reckless to do that type of human engineering on
<br>
people [with what we know now],&quot; argues law professor Henry T. Greely,
<br>
co-director of the Program in Genomics, Ethics and Society at the Stanford
<br>
University Center for Biomedical Ethics.
<br>
<p>To change a baby's eye color or hair color within a fertilized human egg
<br>
&quot;would be a very expensive and dangerous proposition for such trivial
<br>
purposes,&quot; says Dr. Marvin Frazier, who fields human genome questions as
<br>
director of the Life Sciences Division of the U.S. Department of Energy's
<br>
Office of Biological and Environmental Research. &quot;It is also my opinion that
<br>
this would be wrong,&quot; he added, &quot;but that will not stop some people from
<br>
wanting to try.&quot;
<br>
<p>As for manipulating intelligence or athletic ability, Frazier says it will
<br>
take scientists many decades to figure out how to do it. These particular
<br>
traits don't rely on one gene, but on all genes. They also rely &quot;to a
<br>
significant degree&quot; on nurture instead of nature. Even when scientists
<br>
figure it out, &quot;It is likely that to achieve the desired goals would require
<br>
a lot of experimentation, which translates into many hundred or thousands of
<br>
mistakes before you get it right.&quot; That means, Frazier says, &quot;a lot of
<br>
malformed babies and miscarriages.&quot;
<br>
<p>A Pivotal Moment
<br>
<p>To University of Washington professor Phil Bereano, among others, now is the
<br>
time for all of us to talk with friends and colleagues to hash out the
<br>
ethical and societal implications of this Brave New World. Do we really want
<br>
to commodify people? Could it be a Pandora's box? Unfortunately, the box may
<br>
already be open: Many nations have banned genetic engineering on humans, but
<br>
the United States has not.
<br>
<p>&quot;If scientists don't play God, who will?&quot; said supporter James Watson,
<br>
former head of the Human Genome Project, speaking before the British
<br>
Parliamentary and Scientific Committee in June.
<br>
&quot;The key question is not whether human [genetic] manipulation will occur,
<br>
but how and when it will,&quot; says a confident Gregory Stock, director of
<br>
UCLA's Program on Science, Technology and Society in a report entitled, &quot;The
<br>
Prospects for Human Germline Engineering.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, a long-anticipated September report by the American Association
<br>
for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) surprised some observers by failing to
<br>
call for a ban on making inheritable genetic changes in humans--that is,
<br>
genetic changes that would be carried on by progeny. Indeed, while the
<br>
report says that such research &quot;cannot presently be carried out safely and
<br>
responsibly on human beings,&quot; it also leaves wiggle room. &quot;Human trials of
<br>
inheritable genetic changes should not be initiated until reliable
<br>
techniques for gene correction or replacement are developed that meet
<br>
agreed-upon standards for safety and efficacy,&quot; says report co-author Mark
<br>
Frankel, director of AAAS' Scientific Freedom, Responsibility and Law
<br>
Program.
<br>
<p><p><p>Noting the public outcry after the cloning of Dolly the sheep--which raised
<br>
the possibility of cloned human beings--the report stresses the importance
<br>
of public discussion about genetic research before major technical
<br>
innovations occur. So instead of a ban, the report suggests &quot;rigorous
<br>
analysis and public dialogue.&quot;
<br>
<p>But there's no shortage of opposition to human engineering. The San
<br>
Francisco-based Exploratory Initiative on the New Human Genetic Technologies
<br>
seeks, among other things, to alert a largely unwitting public to what is
<br>
going on. &quot;It really is a nightmare vision,&quot; says Rich Hayes, who
<br>
coordinates the campaign from his Public Media Center office. &quot;Once we start
<br>
genetically re-engineering human beings, where would we stop? We should have
<br>
the maturity and wisdom to ban the modification of the genes we pass to our
<br>
children.&quot;
<br>
<p>Designer Genes
<br>
<p>The futuristic notion of choosing a child's genes from a catalog can
<br>
certainly capture the imagination. Just as parents today enroll their
<br>
children in the best possible schools and pay for orthodontics, the parents
<br>
of the future--perhaps in a few decades--would be able to choose from an
<br>
ever-increasing suite of traits: hair color, eye color, bigger muscles and
<br>
so on.
<br>
<p>Maybe they'd like to add a few inches to a child's height. Or improve a
<br>
kid's chances at longevity by tweaking inherited DNA. Or ensure a resistance
<br>
to viruses. Neighborhood clinics could, by appointment, insert a block of
<br>
genes into a newly fertilized egg. As one cell broke into two, then four,
<br>
and so on, each cell would contain the new traits. And the child would pass
<br>
on those traits to all subsequent generations. Who could blame parents for
<br>
going for this?
<br>
<p>But to Stuart Newman, professor of cell biology and anatomy at New York
<br>
Medical College in Valhalla, New York, the effect on human biology could be
<br>
analogous to transforming wild areas into artificial areas, or wild food
<br>
into artificial food.
<br>
<p>We &quot;might be changing people into products--genetically engineered
<br>
products,&quot; says Newman, who also is chairman of the Human Genetics Committee
<br>
for the Council for Responsible Genetics in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
<br>
&quot;That's something that's opened up by the Humane Genome Project.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;We believe that certain activities in the area of genetics and cloning
<br>
should be prohibited because they violate basic environmental and ethical
<br>
principles,&quot; Friends of the Earth President Brent Blackwelder and Physicians
<br>
for Social Responsibility Executive Director Robert Musil said in a 1999
<br>
joint statement. &quot;The idea of redesigning human beings and animals to suit
<br>
the primarily commercial goals of a limited number of individuals is
<br>
fundamentally at odds with the principle of respect for nature.&quot;
<br>
<p>Proponents and critics alike envision a future in which those who can't
<br>
afford gene enrichment will be relegated to second-class citizenship. &quot;As
<br>
far as I'm concerned, this thrill we have about the future will end up being
<br>
one big elitist ripple,&quot; says Beth Burrows, director of the Edmonds
<br>
Institute, a suburban Seattle nonprofit institute that works on issues
<br>
related to environment, technology, ethics and law.
<br>
<p>The Green Dimension
<br>
<p>And what about the environment? Burrows says several important questions
<br>
arise about genetic tampering: What are we creating? How will it affect the
<br>
natural world? What will be the effect on evolution for each species
<br>
involved? How will it change feeding patterns, or food for other animals?
<br>
Without understanding interactions, she says, &quot;We may do some extremely
<br>
stupid things. If people are concerned that there was such a severe backlash
<br>
against genetically modified foods, I think they haven't seen anything
<br>
compared to the backlash when we are able to alter the human genome in
<br>
significant ways--even insignificant ways,&quot; says Burrows.
<br>
<p>UCLA's Gregory Stock agrees the impact of human genetic modification is
<br>
profound, but he likes it. &quot;This technology will force us to re-examine even
<br>
the very notion of what it means to be human,&quot; he wrote in a recent report.
<br>
&quot;For as we become subject to the same process of conscious design that has
<br>
so dramatically altered the world around us, we will be unable to avoid
<br>
looking at what distinguishes us from other life, at how our genetics shapes
<br>
us, at how much we are willing to intervene in life's flow from parent to
<br>
child.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ignacio Chapela of University of California at Berkeley is troubled by still
<br>
other implications the Human Genome Project may bring for the natural
<br>
world--including plants engineered specifically to produce human proteins,
<br>
and pigs produced to have antigens that are more human-like in a quest to
<br>
help humans. To Chapela, a professor in the Department of Environmental
<br>
Science, Policy and Management, the concept, say, of using chimpanzees as
<br>
surrogate mothers for human embryos is &quot;abhorrent--degrading for
<br>
chimpanzees, and for humans, as well. I think what we're talking about is a
<br>
very deep understanding of what it means to be part of an intricate web of
<br>
life, and why we have boundaries between species.&quot; To Chapela, proponents
<br>
see the world as a sphere smeared with mix-and-match DNA. &quot;Evolutionarily,
<br>
it makes sense to have boundaries,&quot; he says, &quot;and we're just willy-nilly
<br>
breaking them down.&quot;
<br>
<p>A Brave New World
<br>
<p>None of these developments will occur in a vacuum; great advancements in
<br>
robotics are also expected, portending a trend toward the melding of man and
<br>
machine in a quest for greater human longevity--to age 110, 130 and beyond.
<br>
UCLA's Stock dubs this new human/machine &quot;Metaman,&quot; a &quot;global
<br>
superorganism.&quot; If it seems like mere musings stolen from a science-fiction
<br>
film, consider this bit of reality: In March, Berkeley researchers announced
<br>
that they had invented the first &quot;bionic chip&quot;--part living tissue, part
<br>
machine. Eventually, such chips and circuitry could help in the development
<br>
of body implants for treating genetic diseases such as diabetes.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a key discovery because it's the first step to building complex
<br>
circuitry that incorporates the living cell,&quot; mechanical engineering
<br>
professor Boris Rubinsky, who created the device with a graduate student,
<br>
said afterward. &quot;The first electronic diode made it possible to have the
<br>
computer. Who knows what the first biological diode will make possible?&quot;
<br>
<p>UCLA's Stock isn't concerned about the effects of human genetic engineering
<br>
on nature. &quot;Even if half the world's species were lost, enormous diversity
<br>
would still remain,&quot; he argues in his 1993 book, Metaman: The Merging of
<br>
Humans and Machines into a Global Superorganism. &quot;We best serve ourselves,
<br>
as well as future generations, by focusing on the short-term consequences of
<br>
our actions rather than our vague notions about the needs of the distant
<br>
future…If medical science develops an easy cure for cancer, [nuclear] wastes
<br>
may not be viewed as a significant health hazard after all. If robots can be
<br>
employed to safely concentrate and reprocess the radioactive materials, they
<br>
might even be valuable.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>Not so fast, says another architect of the modern world, Bill Joy, the
<br>
father of Java software and co-founder of Sun Microsystems. Joy posits with
<br>
some feeling of guilt that &quot;our most powerful 21st-century technologies…are
<br>
threatening to make humans an endangered species.&quot; In a celebrated article
<br>
in Wired magazine last year, Joy blamed the possible extinction of humans on
<br>
a few key causes, including genetic engineering and robotics. Artificial
<br>
intelligence should match that of humans within 20 or 30 years.
<br>
<p>To combat the perceived inevitability of this Brave New World, Marcy
<br>
Darnovsky, a Sonoma State University instructor who works with the
<br>
Exploratory Initiative on the New Human Genetic Technologies, calls for
<br>
three things: First, a global ban on inheritable genetic engineering on
<br>
humans; second, a global ban on human reproductive cloning; and third, an
<br>
effective and accountable regulation of other human genetic technologies.
<br>
<p>Burrows says we need to be pondering such weighty questions as: Do we really
<br>
want to merge with machines? &quot;There are tremendous--awful--choices to be
<br>
made,&quot; she says. &quot;It's very risky to have these discussions because they're
<br>
about common values. The subject is difficult, painful and easily avoided.
<br>
But we have to stop focusing on the science and think of ourselves as part
<br>
of an ecosystem.&quot;
<br>
<p>Chapela is also worried about the lack of civic discourse. But the advocates
<br>
are talking, particularly among themselves. At a Berkeley conference, one of
<br>
them, Extropy Institute President Max More, stood before the crowd and read
<br>
an open letter to Mother Nature:
<br>
<p>Sorry to disturb you, but we humans--your offspring--come to you with some
<br>
things to say:
<br>
<p>You have raised us from simple self-replicating chemicals to trillion-celled
<br>
mammals;
<br>
<p>What you have made us is glorious, yet deeply flawed;
<br>
<p>We will no longer tolerate the tyranny of aging and death. Through genetic
<br>
alterations, cellular manipulations, synthetic organs, and any necessary
<br>
means, we will endow ourselves with enduring vitality and remove our
<br>
expiration date.&quot;
<br>
<p>Other proponents are more sober, and include Nobel laureate scientists.
<br>
&quot;This is no 'marginal' movement or way of thinking,&quot; Chapela says. &quot;The
<br>
group advocating human re-engineering includes extremely powerful,
<br>
influential and wealthy people. So don't expect them to roll over easily or
<br>
soon.&quot;
