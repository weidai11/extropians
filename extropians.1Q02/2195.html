Extropy Institute cordially invites you to join its new Community forum at
<br>
Yahoo.  &lt;<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExI-Community">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ExI-Community</a>&gt;  This is a community
<br>
resource that is all about YOU!  It is a self-service environment for YOU to
<br>
use for YOUR purposes.  It is not merely intended to promote extropy,
<br>
Extropy Institute, or the memes of transhumanism.  It is intended to promote
<br>
YOU and what YOU care about in transhumanism.
<br>
<p>Do you want to let other transhumanists know who you are and how to contact
<br>
you?  Fill out an entry in the Contact Database.
<br>
<p>Do you want other transhumanists to know what you look like?  Upload your
<br>
face picture into the Photo Album.
<br>
<p>Do you want to have some intelligent conversation for a change?  Go into the
<br>
chat room and talk in real-time to other transhumanists.
<br>
<p>Are you looking for a job?  Offering a job?  Selling something?  Need
<br>
volunteers?  Need a roommate?  Need a ride?  Check out the want-ads, by
<br>
transhumanists for transhumanists.
<br>
<p>Do you have recommendations for movies, books or events?  Give a brief
<br>
review of it, and read how other transhumans review it.
<br>
<p>Did you ever want to promote your personal website or your business to other
<br>
transhumanists, but felt it might be off-topic?  Not anymore!  Bookmark your
<br>
personal page.  Bookmark your business offerings.  Bookmark your
<br>
organizations.
<br>
<p>Promote yourself and your interests.  Put your resume online where everyone
<br>
can find it.  Put all your writings online and bookmark them here.  Promote
<br>
your projects and ideas.  Don't be shy.  This forum is for YOU!
<br>
<p>Ever wonder what other transhumanists think?  Ever wonder if your ideas are
<br>
common among transhumanists or in the minority?  Ever wonder how many of us
<br>
there are, who we are, and what we are like?  Take a look at the community
<br>
polls!  It sure would be interesting to see our various ages, our genders,
<br>
our incomes, our orientations, our marital statuses, our religious beliefs,
<br>
our political beliefs, and other demographic data.  For the first time we
<br>
can get a picture of the community as a whole.
<br>
<p>It also would be interested to compare notes.  How many are signed up for
<br>
cryonics?  How many take life-extending nutrients?  How many practice
<br>
calorie restriction?  When do we predict the singularity?  Where do we
<br>
expect the next major breakthrough?  Express your opinion and see what
<br>
everyone else thinks as well!
<br>
<p>All polls will be anonymous, unscientific, and just for fun.  If you have
<br>
any other questions you would like the community to answer, send me a note
<br>
and I'll add a poll.  What's our favorite food?  What's our favorite
<br>
computer?  Our favorite TV show?  How many of us own guns?  How many used to
<br>
hold religious beliefs?  Anything goes.  Whatever you want to know, send me
<br>
a note and I'll add a poll.  I will propose the wording in the discussion
<br>
area, and work with all the suggestions to get the wording right, make it a
<br>
fair question, and make sure we list all the possibilities.  Then we'll poll
<br>
and find out what we always wanted to know.
<br>
<p>We also have a calendar section.  Tired of hearing about all our activities
<br>
after they happened?  We are doing so much that nobody can keep up with it
<br>
all.  Schedule all your gatherings and events so that everyone can see them.
<br>
Look and see what other transhumanists have scheduled.  Don't let your
<br>
events go unnoticed anymore!
<br>
<p>This will be the first forum that is actually about YOU and your community.
<br>
Online photos, files, links, databases, polls, calendars, and anything else
<br>
we can think up that we would like to have.  No single organization or
<br>
website can keep up with all of us.  Each of us need to contribute and
<br>
maintain our own information for the whole community to see.  Anything we
<br>
should be sharing or doing together as a community should be promoted
<br>
through this forum.  It won't replace any other forums, but will be a
<br>
stepping stone to help everybody meet everybody else.
<br>
<p>If YOU aren't promoted at this site, don't blame me!  I'm just the doorman
<br>
and your host.  Once you get in, what you do in your community is up to you.
<br>
Please visit soon and participate whenever you can.  Send any questions,
<br>
comments and especially suggestions to me at &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20ExI:%20%20Announcing%20ExI-Community%20at%20Yahoo!">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;.
