Freethought Radio SignatureHi Guys and Gals. I just read this article from
<br>
the Washington Post about Bush being the new leader for the Christian
<br>
Coalition. Sounds interesting.
<br>
<p>Religious Right Finds Its Center in Oval Office
<br>
<p>Bush Emerges as Movement's Leader After Robertson Leaves
<br>
<p>By Dana Milbank
<br>
<p>Washington Post Staff Writer
<br>
<p>Monday, December 24, 2001; Page A02
<br>
<p>Pat Robertson's resignation this month as president of the Christian
<br>
Coalition confirmed the ascendance of a new leader of the religious right in
<br>
America: George W. Bush.
<br>
<p>For the first time since religious conservatives became a modern political
<br>
movement, the president of the United States has become the movement's de
<br>
facto leader -- a status even Ronald Reagan, though admired by religious
<br>
conservatives, never earned. Christian publications, radio and television
<br>
shower Bush with praise, while preachers from the pulpit treat his
<br>
leadership as an act of providence. A procession of religious leaders who
<br>
have met with him testify to his faith, while Web sites encourage people to
<br>
fast and pray for the president.
<br>
<p>There are several reasons for the adulation. Religious conservatives have
<br>
regarded Bush as one of their own since the presidential campaign, when he
<br>
spoke during a debate of the guidance of Jesus. At the same time, key
<br>
figures in the religious right -- Robertson, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson,
<br>
Billy Graham and Franklin Graham -- have receded in political prominence or
<br>
influence, in part because they are no longer mobilized by their opposition
<br>
to a president. Bush's handling of the anti-terrorism campaign since Sept.
<br>
11 has solidified his standing by painting him in stark terms as the leader
<br>
in a fight of good against evil.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think Robertson stepped down because the position has already been
<br>
filled,&quot; said Gary Bauer, a religious conservative who challenged Bush in
<br>
the Republican primary. Bush &quot;is that leader right now. There was already a
<br>
great deal of identification with the president before 9-11 in the world of
<br>
the Christian right, and the nature of this war is such that it's heightened
<br>
the sense that a man of God is in the White House.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ralph Reed, who once led the Christian Coalition and now is chairman of the
<br>
Georgia GOP, notes that the religious conservative movement &quot;no longer plays
<br>
the institutional role it once did,&quot; in part because it succeeded in
<br>
electing Bush and other friendly leaders. &quot;You're no longer throwing rocks
<br>
at the building; you're in the building.&quot;
<br>
<p>Conservative Christians tend to view Bush's recent success as part of a
<br>
divine plan. &quot;I've heard a lot of 'God knew something we didn't,' &quot; Reed
<br>
said. &quot;In the evangelical mind, the notion of an omniscient God is central
<br>
to their theology. He had a knowledge nobody else had: He knew George Bush
<br>
had the ability to lead in this compelling way.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bush himself dismisses the notion that he is part of some divine plan. &quot;He
<br>
does not believe he was chosen for this moment,&quot; a senior aide said. &quot;He
<br>
just views himself as governing on his beliefs and his promises. He doesn't
<br>
look at himself as a leader of any particular movement.&quot;
<br>
<p>Still, some of those around Bush say they have a sense that a higher purpose
<br>
is involved. &quot;I think President Bush is God's man at this hour, and I say
<br>
this with a great sense of humility,&quot; Bush aide Tim Goeglein, described as a
<br>
&quot;strong evangelical,&quot; told World magazine, a Christian publication.
<br>
<p>Partially a victim of their own success, groups such as the Christian
<br>
Coalition are finding fundraising difficult. Some leaders, such as Focus on
<br>
the Family's Dobson, have retreated from political involvement.
<br>
<p>Some religious conservative leaders have inflicted wounds on themselves.
<br>
Falwell was roundly criticized, even by supporters, for saying on
<br>
television, with Robertson's agreement, that &quot;abortionists and the
<br>
feminists, and the gays and lesbians&quot; and civil libertarians were to blame
<br>
in part for the Sept. 11 attacks. Franklin Graham produced a furor by
<br>
declaring Islam a &quot;very evil and wicked religion.&quot;
<br>
<p>Voting patterns also show a declining religious right. Karl Rove, Bush's top
<br>
political strategist, said that only 15 million of the 19 million religious
<br>
conservatives who should have voted went to the polls in 2000. &quot;We may be
<br>
seeing to some degree some return to the sidelines of previously involved
<br>
religious conservatives,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>And Bush, his advisers acknowledge, deliberately circumvented the power of
<br>
the leaders of the religious right, appealing to conservatives himself
<br>
rather than paying homage to the Christian Coalition during the campaign.
<br>
&quot;In the old days, Republican presidential candidates went to religious
<br>
conservative leaders to seek their imprimatur,&quot; said a Bush adviser. &quot;George
<br>
W. Bush was able to go directly to those who sat in the pews.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bush's effort succeeded. &quot;He is the leader of the Christian right,&quot; said
<br>
Marshall Wittmann, a former Christian Coalition figure now with the Hudson
<br>
Institute, a think tank. &quot;As their institutions peel away, he can go over
<br>
the heads&quot; of religious conservative leaders.
<br>
<p>Bush, aided by speechwriter Michael Gerson, himself a religious
<br>
conservative, speaks the language of religion better than any president
<br>
since Jimmy Carter, religious leaders say, and Bush's policies appeal more
<br>
to conservatives. To many outside the religious conservative movement,
<br>
Bush's faith-infused words may sound sanctimonious; to those within it, the
<br>
words sound familiar and comforting. Across the country, churchgoers share
<br>
Bush's &quot;testimony,&quot; his discovery of God 15 years ago with the help of Billy
<br>
Graham. &quot;Reverend Graham planted a mustard seed in my soul, a seed that grew
<br>
over the next year,&quot; Bush's memoir recounts. &quot;He led me to the path, and I
<br>
began walking. It was the beginning of a change in my life.&quot;
<br>
<p>As Bush had embraced religious conservatism, religious conservatives have
<br>
openly embraced him. The Internet has several sites offering prayers for the
<br>
president's success. One example: &quot;Call on the name of the Lord to hedge him
<br>
in from terrorists and violent people. Psalm 91:11-12; 1 Corinthians
<br>
1:10-11.&quot;
<br>
<p>World magazine, which is edited by one-time Bush adviser Marvin Olasky,
<br>
named Bush's attorney general, John D. Ashcroft, its &quot;Daniel of the Year.&quot;
<br>
Ashcroft himself considered running for president in 2000 as the candidate
<br>
of the religious right. &quot;Just as the biblical Daniel faced an established
<br>
idol-worshiping religion in Babylon, so our Dans must not back down in the
<br>
face of deadly persecution abroad or the scorn and harassment that comes
<br>
domestically from the academic and media high priests of our established
<br>
religion, secular liberalism,&quot; Olasky wrote.
<br>
<p>The top Daniel, of course, is Bush himself, a view liberally offered by the
<br>
many religious figures who pass through the White House. In an account of
<br>
one such meeting, Jean Bethke Elshtain, a professor at the University of
<br>
Chicago Divinity School, wrote of a &quot;powerful and moving moment&quot; with Bush
<br>
and an ecumenical group of religious leaders. &quot;One of our group asked, 'Mr.
<br>
President, what can we do for you?' He indicated that we could 'pray for me,
<br>
for our country, for my family.' He believes in the efficacy of prayer and
<br>
needs wisdom and guidance and grace, he said. A Greek Orthodox archbishop
<br>
was invited to lead us in prayer. We all joined hands in a prayer circle,
<br>
including the president.&quot;
