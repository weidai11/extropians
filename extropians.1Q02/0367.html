Subject: &gt;H invisible friends and a few considerations on piost-biological darwinism, too.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...and will make my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition closer to Gregory Bateson's notion of &quot;mind&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://www.narberthpa.com/Bale/lsbale_dop/learn.htm">http://www.narberthpa.com/Bale/lsbale_dop/learn.htm</a>).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) the components are themselves organisms, possessing internal states and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to build maps, or models, of their environment. these maps can be of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; three kinds: maps of the external environment, maps of themselves inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this environment, maps of their relation between them and the environment).
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ...In other words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observation, in anthropological matters , is less important than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance, one cannot, in analyzing a communication situation, make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past history of the participants irrelevant, and eliminate it in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obtain a &quot;pure&quot; situation. this is the very example given, by Gregory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bateson to, explain the difference between the &quot;pleroma &quot; (the world of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter, of physics) and &quot;creatura&quot; (the world of biology, of information, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication). &quot;if I hit a ball, he said, the way the ball will react is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function of the strength of my hit, and of course, of the various parameters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as the ground, air, gravity, etc. But if I hit a dog, the reaction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dog will not be function, excepted perhaps marginally, of the strength
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my hit. It will be function of the history of the relationship of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dog with me (and this includes of course, the relationship, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation, the dog has about all humans).&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dog is made up of physical materials and processes embedded in the objective universe. Its behavior is certainly different
<br>
from kicking a rock, a ball, a gob of nitroglycerine, a cranky computer, or a delusional Statism fundamentalist. Each of these
<br>
systems has general properties that can be teased out from the study of their past histories. The observation of patterns of
<br>
behavior in natural systems precedes the deduction of a theory, or model, of the system that can then be used to predict its future
<br>
states after application of the step-function stimulus- cf the earlier post on Argentinian banks and hyperinflation. As you say,
<br>
each new situation is unique, indeterminate, and different from all others, thus a scientific prediction cannot be totally accurate.
<br>
The true believer- a system composed of an adult human partially locked into an unsustainable delusional state- is especially simple
<br>
to model, as the belief structure forms an internal control system that outputs mechanical, robotic responses to external stimuli.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Bateson's two-part division of the world suffers, like all divisions must,  from a simplification that can constrain further
<br>
inquiry. This is of course an artificial method of dividing up the spheres of mental processes; a 'framework' for a 'picture'.
<br>
Sometimes this particular division is useful, other times it obscures. The question &quot;what is life?&quot; is far from settled; biology can
<br>
be considered a subset of physics; physics can be partially unified under the principle of extreme physical information (EPI).
<br>
Philosphers in particular seem prone to locking in to a particular framework, then attempting to make everything fit into it.
<br>
Dialetical Materialism and Marxism are notorious examples of thoroughly refuted toxic meme-complexes that refuse to dry up and blow
<br>
away. They cross-breed and resurge in the doctrines of Fabianism, Communitarianism, Social Democracy, (the original name of the
<br>
Bolsheviks/Mensheviks, btw), Keynesianism, Neoconservatism, and so forth.  Thus, we look for an underlying explanation for the
<br>
persistence of these dynamical structures.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The techcniques of switching pictures, frameworks, or models, has proven very sucessful in scientific inquiry- flipping the
<br>
telescope around, rotating the interferometer, blocking off one slit or another, changing to a different mathematical model, and
<br>
selecting what to include or exclude from observation. Forming ensembles of 'frameworks', or imaginary divisions of systems in
<br>
multiple combinations, can demonstrate the exisistence or non-existence of holistic residues. Performing these operations on the
<br>
holistic constructs of Keynesianism, as the Austrian School theoreticians have done so well, is like peeling the layers from an
<br>
onion: there is no pit or residue- the center does not hold.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... A few days ago, for instance, there was this very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting Paul Hugues's post where he mentioned and tried, rightly imho,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to criticize the point of view of some famous transhumanists about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future of competition between uploaded beings: a very dark, harsh vision,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dominated by fierce competition and ruthless greediness. It seem that, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these thinkers (who are some of the best and sophisticated transhumanist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writers around) it is possible to imagine human evolving not only in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtual world, but even becoming without bodies and environment, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virtual, working as pure software (an hypothesis I find personally extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weird), but that the most primitive form of interaction through fight and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition will continue to lead the game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, I think this kind of reasoning is one of the major defects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanism.Again, I don't say that this is your point of view (that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't know on this precise topic),
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not share the &quot;dark, harsh visions&quot; on these subjects. I did see Paul Hughes's email, it sat in the inbox for awhile but I
<br>
didn't get around to replying. Perhaps the notion of fierce competition is a perceptual artifact stemming from existing in a
<br>
ladder-climbing, rent-seeking, hirearchical environment (no offense intended). The real-life examples of co-opetition between
<br>
quasi-species on mutually deforming fitness landscapes seen in economies and ecosystems appears more applicable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a low critical mass for consciousness that negates the possibility of a singulatarian Jupiter Brain. Propagation
<br>
delays between sections of the big brain would exceed the time needed for one section to change its mind about whatever the subject
<br>
was. The Turing stopping problem as well as the butterfly effect makes that future state unknowable to the rest of the brain, hence
<br>
it is at continuous risk of section defection. The complexity catastrophe may limit the nanotech brain to something smaller than a
<br>
breadbox. Defending a large, unmaneuverable spherical object against standoff directed-energy weapons and relativistic bombing is
<br>
geometrically similar (compounded by the three-dimensionality) to Hannibal's annihilation of the Roman army at Carthage. Therefore,
<br>
its construction would probably not even be attempted. Outer space is not in short supply; good fences make good neighbors.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It requires less resources for a critical-mass consciousness to interact with the real world sans the virtual-reality-interface
<br>
markup costs. Thus, it has a type of fitness not found in the liquid infomorph system. It is just as plausible that the contemporary
<br>
'ecosystem' of computation will become more complex and expand throughout the Solar System. The biological world can be caracictured
<br>
as beetles, bacteria, and a few other organisms. Similarly, the present-day computer 'ecosystem' is composed of billions of 4- and
<br>
8-bit microprocessors, plus single money. The tiny machines help out the bigger ones and vice versa- the quasi-static Nash
<br>
equilibrium of &quot;Mutually Assured Construction&quot;. One does not use an 8051 to model climate, nor a Blue Gene to run the toaster. The
<br>
natural order of division of labor in a free market allows each kind of machine to do what it is most fit for. The absense of
<br>
deception, coersion, and associated rent-seeking behavior of the machines themselves is partly responsible for Moore's observation.
<br>
The overhead costs associated with socialistic schemes-holding virtual guns to virtual heads, swarms of bureaucratic software agents
<br>
eating out productive agent's substrate, jupiterbrainwashing, infomorphs coursing through the system prattling on about facilitating
<br>
social contracts, and all the rest,
<br>
would produce a less fit system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now a few speculations about &quot;the state&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we admit that societies are [&quot;superorganisms&quot;],
</em><br>
<p>What exactically is a superorganism? I wrote: &quot;The notion that the physical structures of civilization resemble a &quot;superorganism&quot; is
<br>
sometimes put forth. It has some utility, as the functions and evolved structures of these artifacts appear to have analogs in the
<br>
biological realm.&quot;, which did not make any claim of identity between &quot;society&quot; (whatever that is) and a &quot;superorganism&quot; (whatever
<br>
that is).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we speculate they possess,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in turn, representation or maps of their environment, and representation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves. these different maps being materialized in form of &quot;social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institution&quot;. One may ask if the central power structure of the society is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not such a map.
</em><br>
<p>I think my earlier proposition of &quot;a giant Stanford Prison Experiment&quot; is close to the mark:
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
&quot;...there is a tendency on the part of this Government to overstep the boundaries marked out for it by the Constitution. ... one
<br>
evil example will lead to other measures still more mischievous; and if the principle of constructive powers or supposed advantages
<br>
or temporary circumstances shall ever be permitted to justify the assumption of a power not given by the Constitution, the General
<br>
Government will before long absorb all the powers of legislation, and you will have in effect but one consolidated government...&quot;
<br>
--Andrew Jackson's farewell speech, March 4, 1837
<br>
<p>&quot;In addition to all this, the habit of dealing with large sums will make the government avaricious and profuse. The system itself
<br>
will infallibly generate the base vermin of spies and informers, and a still more pestilent race of political tools and retainers,
<br>
of the meanest and most odious description, while the prodigious patronage, which the collecting of this splendid revenue will throw
<br>
into the hands of the government, will invest it in so vast an influence, and hold out such means and temptations to corruption, as
<br>
all the virtue and public spirit, even of republicans, will be unable to resist.&quot;
<br>
--McGuffy's Fourth Reader, 1838
<br>
<p>&quot;There were three types of guards. First, there were tough but fair guards who followed prison rules. Second, there were &quot;good guys&quot;
<br>
who did little favors for the prisoners and never punished them. And finally, about a third of the guards were hostile, arbitrary,
<br>
and inventive in their forms of prisoner humiliation. These guards appeared to thoroughly enjoy the power they wielded, yet none of
<br>
our preliminary personality tests were able to predict this behavior. The only link between personality and prison behavior was a
<br>
finding that prisoners with a high degree of authoritarianism endured our authoritarian prison environment longer than did other
<br>
prisoners.&quot;

<br>
<p>&quot;...[since] they would have to do these things whether they wanted to or not; and the probability of the people in power being
<br>
individuals who would dislike the possession and exercise of power is on a level with the probability that an extremely
<br>
tender-hearted person would get the job of whipping-master in a slave plantation.&quot;
<br>
--Frank H. Knight, 1938 [quoted in Hayek, pp 167]
<br>
<p>&quot;I was sitting there all alone, waiting anxiously for the intruders to break in, when who should happen along but a colleague and
<br>
former Yale graduate student roommate, Gordon Bower. Gordon had heard we were doing an experiment, and he came to see what was going
<br>
on. I briefly described what we were up to, and Gordon asked me a very simple question: &quot;Say, what's the independent variable in
<br>
this study?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;To my surprise, I got really angry at him. Here I had a prison break on my hands. The security of my men and the stability of my
<br>
prison was at stake, and now, I had to deal with this bleeding-heart, liberal, academic, effete dingdong who was concerned about the
<br>
independent variable! It wasn't until much later that I realized how far into my prison role I was at that point -- that I was
<br>
thinking like a prison superintendent rather than a research psychologist.&quot;
<br>
--Philip. G. Zimbardo, 1999
<br>
<a href="http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-27.htm">http://www.prisonexp.org/slide-27.htm</a>
<br>
<p>and there is no independent variable. There is no governor for the governor; no lender of last resort for the lender of last resort.
<br>
--------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One interesting thing is that, even long before the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invention of democracy, the ruling power, the government, has always been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought to be, in some way, representative.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;[A] myth concerns the historic transition from absolute monarchies to democratic states. Not only do neoconservatives interpret
<br>
this development as progress; there is near universal agreement that democracy represents an advance over monarchy and is the cause
<br>
of economic and moral progress. This interpretation is curious in light of the fact that democracy, in the twentieth century, has
<br>
been the fountainhead of every form of socialism: of (European) democratic socialism and (American) &quot;liberalism&quot; and neoconservatism
<br>
as well as of international (Soviet) socialism, (Italian) fascism, and national (Nazi) socialism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;More importantly, however, theory contradicts this interpretation; whereas both monarchies and democracies are deficient as
<br>
states, democracy is worse than monarchy at keeping the size and reach of the state in check....&quot;
<br>
--Hans-Hermann Hoppe, 2002
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy can be modeled as two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for lunch. Back to Planet X, populated by three ideal-type
<br>
persons:
<br>
&quot;... Party C may entertain the private notion that he is entitled to take things claimed by Party A and dole some &quot;fair share&quot; of
<br>
them out to Party B (less the vig of course), e.g. the Social Security swindle. Parties A and B may or may not hold similar views.
<br>
Regardless of the unknowable individual views of any of the persons, there are no external factors at work....&quot;
<br>
Come the elections, Party B (who may be a member of a state-chartered corporation) will climb out of his couch just long enough to
<br>
vote for the hand that feeds him: Party C. Party C will also vote for Party C. Majority rules. Party A might decide it's easier to
<br>
switch than fight, hence he too becomes a recipient like Party B. This is a classic runaway system- the mechanism behind the
<br>
collapse of Rome, the Soviet Union, and many other examples. Now playing in Argentina. I think it was Aristotle that first noticed
<br>
this progression: Monarchy -&gt; Republic -&gt; Democracy -&gt; Dictatorship (-&gt;collapse), a lietmotif of the past few centuries of Western
<br>
history.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Confederations, republics, divisions of jurisdiction and execution, and proscribing limits on the applications of compulsion and
<br>
coersion (sometimes referred to as the government, or barrel of the gun) are attempts to avoid the tyranny of the majority- to
<br>
provide for the general welfare, not the specific welfare, of this or that imagined special interest. Coersion requires an
<br>
enforcement mechanism. Each new rule requires passing several more to counteract the negative effects of the first, thus the
<br>
67,000ish new US federal regulations passed in 2000. This too, is a classic, positive-feedback, runaway control system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even the king, in feudal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, was not considered as the biggest alpha male of the crowd, but was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen as a kind of symbol of the country. this is beautifully summarized in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John Boorman's Excalibur, when Parsifal says to King Arthur: &quot;you and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land are one&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Beautifully&quot; is not the only adverb available to qualify this summary. Mr. Arthur was (or may have been) considered a man,
<br>
whereas land is considered to be dry terrain on Earth. It is quite a stretch to consider these two classes of objects identical.
<br>
Compose and decompse this claim of ownership by inclusion and exclusion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And of course, the map is not the territory, and the representation will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never be completely accurate. But is this a reason to think that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation is a pure fiction and that it could disappear?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representation of myself is certainly inaccurate, but I need one in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act. In the same way, how to act in meaningful political way if one doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept to work with these social representations ?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning is entirely personal and subjective, there does not appear to be any external authority capable of providing this service
<br>
to the individual. The bulk of social representations, or political theories, appear to be apologetics for the staples of Statism-
<br>
murder, robbery, kidnapping, enslavement, theft by deception, and the public-commons production of other &quot;bads&quot;. Court philosophers
<br>
of every era seem prone to claiming their world the best of all possible. Calls for acceptance of consensus reality, scientific
<br>
consensus, fads, manias, and manufactured social representations cannot apriori yield useful models. The objective reality of the
<br>
manifest universe is not subject to the ballot box.
