<em>&gt; the question is why haven't they even left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything lying around that we can /see/?
</em><br>
<p>So, either they don't exist or they don't exist in detectable form,
<br>
obviously.
<br>
Being wise beyond caring, they'd stay in their carefree homes, far from
<br>
view.
<br>
I suspect that very advanced, technologically savvy civilizations would
<br>
discover better alternatives to interstellar travel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Surely someone capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interstellar travel is also capable of large-scale engineering.  Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't we see that Kemplerer rosette?
</em><br>
<p>Capability does not necessitate performance.
<br>
Just because they can do it, doesn't mean they would.

<em>&gt; Hypercognition will only advance when we are able to apply our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering skills to the mind to a significant degree.
</em><br>
<p>Applying engineering skills to the brain (the mind is a myth) could
<br>
accomplish some practical things, such as to help repair damage that
<br>
prevents the attainment of hyper-cognitive functioning. But the
<br>
hyper-cognitive brain has no use for notions of *further* advancement (as
<br>
every buddha knows), because consilience of all knowledge into a single
<br>
cosmological science discloses the futility of trying to improve this
<br>
perfect and ineffable knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Lamarckian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution of technology will always overtake the Darwinian evolution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology.
</em><br>
<p>Consider that Lamarckian evolution of technology merges extropically with
<br>
Darwinian evolution of biology to enable emergence of the epiphenomenon
<br>
called a hyper-cognitive brain. IOW, consider that the enlightened brain
<br>
knows better than to exchange present hyper-cognition (buddhahood) for
<br>
imagined advances.
<br>
<p>Cognitive phase transition (cognitive Singularity or Enlightenment) explains
<br>
the so-called &quot;Fermi paradox&quot; by pointing out that sufficiently sentient
<br>
beings surrender to existential indifference, because they are wise beyond
<br>
caring. Since extropian buddha brains (as well as equally-evolved supposed
<br>
ETs) would be too intelligent to believe in the end of existence, Gamma Ray
<br>
Bursters may come and go, yet hyper-cognitive phase transition eternally
<br>
recurs.

<p>Why not make our own brains hyper-cognitive right now?
<br>
In _Zen and The Brain_, the book Anders says uses the word &quot;hyperpraxy&quot;
<br>
(what page, Anders?), we read,
<br>
&quot;Have we learned anything about meditation? If so, it will not be from
<br>
applying EEG electrodes to the scalp, but from the deeper act of practicing
<br>
the meditative mode ourselves and infusing it into the present moment.
<br>
Finally, each day's practice starts to become life's meditation, by one
<br>
life, within all life.&quot;
<br>
Except for the notion of &quot;practicing&quot; meditation (it's not something that
<br>
can be practiced), Austin is correct.

<em>&gt; I was suggesting that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we &quot;know&quot; to be a &quot;natural&quot; creation (our universe) may very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well not be.
</em><br>
<p>If it's not &quot;natural,&quot; then it's supernatural.
<br>
Fortunately, we have the scientific method to prove that this is incorrect
<br>
thinking.
<br>
There is absolutely no empirical evidence in support of the supernatural, and
<br>
it therefore remains the domain of immature thinkers.

<em>&gt; Well, I was commenting on JR's reference to the philosophies of various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'illuminated ones', generally of hindu and chinese origin, as being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fruit of the 'most ancient cultures'. Chinese and Indian culture, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measured by the relative age of their written languages compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those of the west, are not so ancient. If you want an illuminated one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a true ancient culture, you can't do any better than the Epic of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gilgamesh. He sought immortality and personal perfection as much as any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern transhumanist, and was not averse to defending himself or earning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a profit either. ;)
</em><br>
<p>I suppose they should be called hyper-cognitive ones instead of &quot;illuminated
<br>
ones.&quot;
<br>
Having read the Dhammapada, I find ample evidence of hyper-cognition.
<br>
Lao Tzu (author of the Tao Te Ching) looks to me more like a scientist of
<br>
cognition, one who recommends direct experience of reality, aka zen, as a
<br>
means to understand life, the universe, and everything.
<br>
The reason for mentioning hyper-cognition was to explain why the so-called
<br>
&quot;Fermi paradox&quot; is a paradox only if one assumes that highly intelligent
<br>
beings would necessarily want to phyically travel between the stars. There
<br>
are, after all, intelligent alternatives to that specific use of technology.
<br>
Furthermore, if it takes a hyper-cognitive being to know a hyper-cognitive
<br>
being, then it may also take an ETI to know an ETI. It makes sense to me that
<br>
an intelligent species would solve its own problems before trying to reach the
<br>
stars... and having solved its own problems, interstellar travel no longer
<br>
appeals. The hyper-cognitive ones seem to have solved their own problems, and
<br>
some of them have apparently tried to pass their wisdom (or the ability to be
<br>
hyper-cognitive) on to others. So, instead of searching for ETIs, I think it's
<br>
more extropic to investigate our own hyper-cognitive capabilities.

<em>&gt; Has anyone here any reason to believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bradburyesque M Brains are inherently impossible?
</em><br>
<p>I have no reason to believe that M Brains are *necessary* to understand how
<br>
reality works, and we need to understand how reality works so that we can act
<br>
wisely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, I suggest we build our M Brains quickly and get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sailing towards the next star, before some other extraterrestrial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yahoo beats us to it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we need to compete with extraterrestrial yahoos, because I think
<br>
that humans will either attain hyper-cognition en masse, or we will commit
<br>
global suicide.
<br>
<p>&quot;Any sufficiently intelligent and powerful weapon is indistinguishable from a
<br>
panacea.&quot;
