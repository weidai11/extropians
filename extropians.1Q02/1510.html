<p>Myths About Enron 
<br>
<p>by William L. Anderson
<br>
<p>[Posted January 18, 2002]
<br>
<p>As the once-formidable Enron Empire continues to implode--and new
<br>
revelations appear daily about the inner workings (and apparent financial
<br>
shenanigans) of this firm--we are treated, not surprisingly, to the wrong
<br>
story by the mainstream news media and their associates from the political
<br>
classes.  It is bad enough to see a huge firm go bankrupt, but what makes
<br>
this situation even worse is the moral and intellectual bankruptcy that
<br>
follows in its wake as the apostles of statism feed the rest of us
<br>
disinformation.
<br>
<p>While the facts (as we know them today) of the Enron debacle are easily
<br>
available in most newspapers and on the Internet, they are accompanied by a
<br>
number of myths that are being spawned by politicians and their media
<br>
allies.  (For example, in decrying the Enron mess, columnist George Will
<br>
declared, &quot;It will remind everyone--some conservatives, painfully--that a
<br>
mature capitalist economy is a government project.&quot;)  I would like to tackle
<br>
a few of these economic and political &quot;old wives' tales&quot; and help set the
<br>
record straight. 
<br>
<p>Myth #1: Enron proves once again that capitalism corrupts politics.
<br>
<p>This seems to be a recurring theme, most recently given by Sen. John McCain
<br>
during an appearance on CBS's &quot;Face the Nation.&quot;  The story goes as such:
<br>
Enron was able to gain political favors by supplying campaign money to
<br>
politicians from both major parties, thereby blinding these otherwise
<br>
public-spirited people from performing their duties to the people.
<br>
<p>Part of this story is true; Enron has given vast sums of cash to both
<br>
Republicans and Democrats.  While Democrats are presently attempting to link
<br>
Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, to President George Bush and Vice
<br>
President Richard Cheney, they conveniently seem to have forgotten that
<br>
Enron in 1997 contributed $100,000 to the Democratic Party immediately after
<br>
President Bill Clinton directly intervened to help Enron gain a $3-billion
<br>
project in India.
<br>
<p>The problem here is that the politicians have it backward.  The energy
<br>
business, including oil and electricity, has been thoroughly politicized for
<br>
about a century.  Producers of electricity, despite what mainstream
<br>
economists like Paul Krugman tell us, have been and continue to be heavily
<br>
regulated, both by state and federal agencies.  Electricity production has
<br>
undergone some changes in its regulatory structure in recent years, but to
<br>
call this process &quot;deregulation&quot; (especially in California, which launched a
<br>
crazy quilt of reregulation that led to the recent energy crisis there) does
<br>
violence to the language.
<br>
<p>Producers of electric power are regulated in every sense of the word, from
<br>
the fuel they use to the prices they can charge customers.  Furthermore, the
<br>
process is subject to the whims of regulators and politicians, and that
<br>
makes it very difficult to plan for the long term, as the stroke of a
<br>
politician's pen (like that of California Governor Gray Davis) can wipe out
<br>
a lifetime of profitable investments.
<br>
<p>Oil is another thoroughly politicized commodity.  Government determines when
<br>
and where individual firms can drill for oil, the extraction processes they
<br>
can use, and, since much of the remaining oil-producing land in the United
<br>
States is in the hands of the federal government, nearly every exploration
<br>
and drilling project is controlled at some level by the political process.
<br>
The fact that Congress continues to bar oil firms from tapping vast oil
<br>
fields located beneath barren lands in northern Alaska bears eloquent
<br>
witness to the fact that the political classes are doing everything they can
<br>
to deny consumers the benefits of fossil fuels.
<br>
<p>Given this set of circumstances, any firm that has anything to do with oil,
<br>
natural gas, or electricity is going to have to pay tribute to our political
<br>
masters.  As Fred McChesney of the Northwestern University Law School so
<br>
eloquently put it, the vast amount of political contributions is nothing
<br>
more than protection money that companies must give to politicians in order
<br>
to be permitted to stay in business.[1]
<br>
<p>Do payments to politicians &quot;buy&quot; political favors?  Of course they do.
<br>
However, the process does not originate with capitalists, but rather has
<br>
been imposed upon capitalists by the politicians.  The line of causality is
<br>
vital, as the politicians once again are trying to blame the wrong people.
<br>
<p>Myth #2: Without proper regulation from government, companies like Enron
<br>
will abuse the financial system.
<br>
<p>Again, the pundits have it backward.  The supposed scenario as presented by
<br>
the media elite is one of the sharp-eyed regulator being stymied in his
<br>
vital work by the politicians who have been bought off by the capitalists.
<br>
A favorite example is that of the &quot;Keating Five,&quot; which was a group of five
<br>
senators (including the &quot;honorable&quot; John McCain) who intervened with banking
<br>
regulators on behalf of Charles Keating, a savings and loan CEO whose
<br>
operations went belly up.
<br>
<p>While the tale sounds good, it is just that: a tale.  To assume that
<br>
government is not a political entity is to assume that dogs do not bark.
<br>
Regulators are part of a system put into place by politicians to benefit
<br>
politicians and their friends.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, this myth is based upon the fiction that regulators care more
<br>
about the health of a business than do its owners.  Take the savings and
<br>
loan crises of the late 1980s, for example.  The oft-repeated story in the
<br>
media was that regulators and bank examiners could see the problems coming,
<br>
but were held at bay by their political masters.
<br>
<p>There is a kernel of truth to that story.  Some regulators did try to sound
<br>
alarms and were squelched by politicians.  However, the story goes much
<br>
deeper.  First, savings and loan industries, being regulated by government
<br>
and being the beneficiaries of government-sponsored deposit insurance, form
<br>
a natural political constituency, or, to put it more succinctly, an interest
<br>
group.  What politicians do has great importance to those in this industry,
<br>
since Washington, D.C., can enrich this industry or impoverish it.
<br>
<p>In the latter 1980s, it seems that Washington was doing both to the S&amp;Ls.
<br>
On the one hand, changes in the regulatory structure enabled these firms to
<br>
better compete with banks by expanding the range of loans they could make.
<br>
On the other hand, Congress voted in tax law changes that damaged real
<br>
estate values, thus devaluing the major set of assets held by S&amp;Ls.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, S&amp;L executives, having learned their trade in a heavily
<br>
regulated environment, suddenly found themselves facing a new set of rules
<br>
and constraints.  It is not surprising that many of them made frightful
<br>
errors in their loan portfolios.  When one combines that lack of free-market
<br>
experience with the congressional order that S&amp;Ls immediately sell their
<br>
high-risk, high-return bonds (called &quot;junk&quot; bonds) assets, it was inevitable
<br>
that there would be a collapse in that financial sector.
<br>
<p>Myth #3: Enron represented the future of free-market energy, as Lay was a
<br>
firm believer in free enterprise.
<br>
<p>Natural monopoly theory, which was concocted by economists about a century
<br>
ago, went like this: Industries where large economies of scale are prevalent
<br>
will soon find one or two firms dominating production and exchange.  In
<br>
order to keep these firms from being able to charge monopoly prices,
<br>
government must step in and regulate them.
<br>
<p>While Austrian economists from Mises on have never subscribed to &quot;natural
<br>
monopoly&quot; theory, others in the profession have also &quot;discovered&quot; that
<br>
electricity, oil, natural gas, and telephone services can be bought and sold
<br>
as commodities in free markets.  As entrepreneurs moved into these areas, we
<br>
found that the regulatory straitjackets around these industries ostensibly
<br>
to &quot;protect&quot; consumers actually were keeping consumers from enjoying
<br>
products and services in more abundance and at lower prices than were
<br>
possible within the regulatory regimes.
<br>
<p>Enron has been one of those &quot;ground floor&quot; firms that both pushed the
<br>
envelope that exposed energy regulation for what it was and created new
<br>
opportunities for the trading of electricity.  That was and will continue to
<br>
be a positive development.  In other ways, however, Enron pushed a gospel of
<br>
statism, especially in environmental matters.
<br>
<p>Lay, a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a radical
<br>
environmentalist and anti-free-market organization, supported the disastrous
<br>
Kyoto Accords on &quot;global warming.&quot;  Enron had banked on trading permits for
<br>
carbon dioxide emissions, which would have been based upon the existing
<br>
permit system for sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning electric power
<br>
plants.  When the Bush administration refused to sign the Kyoto treaty,
<br>
however, Enron was left out in the cold.
<br>
<p>(It needs to be said that a system of trading permits, while carrying a
<br>
façade of free-market operations, is nothing more than state control of
<br>
production.  Such a system has no private property rights and is controlled
<br>
by the arbitrary whims of bureaucrats.
<br>
<p>One of the things that characterized the Enron enterprise was its
<br>
freewheeling ways in financial markets.  There is nothing in economic theory
<br>
that declares free markets are only possible when entrepreneurs wallow in
<br>
irresponsibility.
<br>
<p>However, the Enron mess demonstrates that the marriage of reckless
<br>
entrepreneurs and irresponsible government is always a recipe for disaster.
<br>
During the late 1990s, the Fed engaged in unprecedented credit expansion.
<br>
Of course, the flip side of credit is debt, and there can be no doubt that
<br>
the freewheeling Fed also set the table for Enron's shenanigans.
<br>
<p><p><p>The final blow to the &quot;Enron represents free markets&quot; myth is the action
<br>
that Lay took as it became obvious Enron could not cook its books any
<br>
longer.  Lay phoned the U.S. Department of the Treasury to ask for help. (To
<br>
its credit, the Bush administration did not attempt to bail out the rogue
<br>
firm.)
<br>
<p>There is no doubt that the Enron debacle is a disgrace, both to the
<br>
executives who made these unconscionable decisions and to the federal and
<br>
state governments that made that firm seem as though it was invulnerable to
<br>
market realities.  It is &quot;crony capitalism&quot; at its worst.  Let us remember,
<br>
however, that it was the politicians who corrupted capitalism, not the other
<br>
way around.
