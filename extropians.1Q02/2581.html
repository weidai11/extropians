<em>&gt;New Prospects for Putting Organs on Ice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Jocelyn Kaiser
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After a lull, scientists are again exploring vitrification and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;techniques for deep-freezing tissues and organs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the movie Vanilla Sky, Tom Cruise has his broken body frozen in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hope that he'll someday be revived and healed. In reality, cryonics, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this practice is known, remains the most speculative science fiction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Researchers have failed for decades to deep-freeze and thaw most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tissues--let alone organs or animals--without damaging them, often
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seriously. But recently, a few cryobiologists have celebrated successes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with ovaries and complex tissues like vascular grafts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The work has sparked hope that donated organs can eventually be banked for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;longer than the current few days, which would buy time for distributing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them and finding recipients who are good immunological matches. And as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progress is made engineering artificial livers, bladders, and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tissues containing living cells, the need for better preservation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;techniques is expected to grow (see Viewpoint on p. 1009). &quot;Each company
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at some point will need to store and transport their product,&quot; says Mike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Taylor of Organ Recovery Systems in Charleston, South Carolina.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Currently, transplant surgeons perfuse whole organs with a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution that enables them to be banked just above 0ºC for up to a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt;days. Ideally, they would like to preserve organs at -196ºC, the boiling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point of liquid nitrogen--so cold that molecular motion virtually stops
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and tissues cease to decay. Half a century ago, that seemed within easy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reach. Scientists found that blood and sperm could survive such deep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freezing if mixed with glycerol. The glycerol lowers the cells' freezing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point and keeps them from getting lethally salty when they do freeze and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;water diffuses out. And since 1972, embryos have been frozen with liquid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nitrogen and later successfully implanted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Organs, however, don't hold up so well below the freezing point. Water
</em><br>
<em>&gt;leaked from cells during freezing forms ice crystals in the space between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cells, and this ice destroys fragile structures such as ducts and blood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vessels. Sometimes pieces of organs, such as pancreatic islet cells, work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;adequately after freezing. But larger, more complex organs such as kidneys
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't function properly when sufficiently ravaged.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As a way around this problem, some researchers turned to vitrification, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;ice-free&quot; cryopreservation. The idea is to fill the organ with a viscous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fluid that turns into a glassy (not crystalline) solid at low
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temperatures. This reduces the problems of ice, but toxicity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cryopreservant can still damage organs. And ice crystals tend to form as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vitrified tissue--especially large pieces--is warmed. Partial success came
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the 1980s, when Red Cross scientist Greg Fahy showed that rabbit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kidneys could withstand the high concentrations of cryoprotectants needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to vitrify these organs. They worked when reimplanted, but Fahy had only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cooled them to -3ºC. Many experiments later, it's clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;vitrification is very, very complicated,&quot; says cryobiologist David Pegg
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the University of York, U.K., and in most labs vitrification of large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organs has been on hold.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Recently, cryobiologists have had better luck studying vitrification on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smaller scale. For example, fine-tuning the solutions that are injected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into the organs, as well as heating and cooling rates, minimized injury to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;2- to 3-centimeter-long pieces of rabbit veins, Taylor's team at Organ
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Recovery Systems reported in the 18 March 2000 issue of Nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Biotechnology. The vessels retained 80% of their function when dosed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;drugs that cause them to contract, compared to 20% following simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freezing. When implanted in rabbits, the grafts appeared to work normally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;We're the first to demonstrate [that vitrification works better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freezing] in reasonably complex tissue,&quot; Taylor says. Two other groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have recently shown that they can vitrify corneas, getting much less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage than from freezing. But the scientists have yet to show whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these corneas function in vivo.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Roger Gosden and colleagues at McGill University in Montreal have had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;success even with conventional freezing with a small organ, they reported
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last month in Nature. They froze rat ovaries, fallopian tubes, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attached blood vessels in liquid nitrogen and transplanted them into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;genetically identical rats whose ovaries had been removed. The animals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ovulated. Some ice damage occurred, so vitrification might be even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successful, suggests Gosden, now at the Jones Institute for Reproductive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Medicine in Norfolk, Virginia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Several groups are tackling problems that thwart both vitrification and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conventional freezing. Pegg's group at York, for instance, is working on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how to thaw tissues and avoid ice crystal formation. The team has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed a technique that Pegg says can evenly and quickly heat pingpong
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ball-sized clumps of cells embedded in gelatin to simulate large tissue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Taylor's group, meanwhile, is collaborating with Carnegie Mellon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists on dosing tissues with iron compounds that are then excited
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with magnets to generate heat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Taking a cue from nature, researchers are also using natural antifreeze
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proteins to help mop up crystals formed during freezing and thawing. Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt;organisms, from carrots to fish to beetles, produce proteins that latch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;onto and isolate growing ice crystals. The one drawback is that at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temperatures well below 0ºC, this system can backfire by causing ice
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crystals to form spikes that disrupt cells. Several companies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developing improved synthetic versions of these &quot;ice blockers&quot;; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example, Taylor's company hopes to produce smaller molecules that attach
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to ice crystals at the base as well as the face, which could prevent spike
</em><br>
<em>&gt;formation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Fahy, meanwhile, has never given up trying to vitrify large organs. &quot;He
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has soldiered the way on this for years and years,&quot; Pegg says. Now at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;company called 21st Century Medicine in Rancho Cucamonga, California, Fahy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has tested hundreds of vitrification solutions and patented the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;promising ones. &quot;Greg has always been tantalizingly close to getting it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;work,&quot; says cryobiologist William Rall of the National Institutes of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Health. The company Fahy works for receives funding from the Life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extension Foundation, which supports cryonics. Fahy says his work is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strictly limited to cryopreserving organs. But he adds, &quot;If I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successful, perhaps it will remove some of the [cryonics] controversy.&quot;
</em><br>
