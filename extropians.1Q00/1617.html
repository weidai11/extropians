<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;MTA study&quot; funded by the National Institute 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of Mental Health is being touted as the long-awaited 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;research confirming that long-term (14 month) drugging 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of children with stimulants to control misbehavior is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;more effective than drug-free behavioral therapy. In 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the following report, however, Peter Breggin, MD, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;gives us a second opinion about the findings of this 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;study. The first objection Breggin raises constitutes 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the complete elimination of the study: the study was 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazing! Both the study subjects and those evaluating 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the performance of the subjects knew which subjects 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;were on drugs and which were not, which is known as
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;an &quot;open label&quot; study. The reasons why double-blind 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo-controlled studies are essential for valid 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drug research are basic to established standards 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for scientific research -- standards that the much-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;touted MTA study fails to satisfy. Based on that fact 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;alone, the MTA study is essentially junk science that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;amounts to a taxpayer-funded advertisement for drugs,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;yet that's just the beginning of Breggin's critique:
<BR>

<BR>
A Critical Analysis of the Multimodal Treatment Study for 
<BR>
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (The MTA Study) 
<BR>
<P>by Peter R. Breggin, M.D. 
<BR>
January 12, 2000 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After many months of positive publicity in the psychiatric 
<BR>
and the general media, the results of the Multimodal Treatment
<BR>
Study for Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (The MTA Study) 
<BR>
were finally published in December 1999 (MTA Cooperative Group, 
<BR>
1999a&amp;b).  The study was sponsored by the National Institute of 
<BR>
Mental Health (NIMH) at six separate sites in the United States.  
<BR>
At each site, the study compared four treatment conditions: (1) 
<BR>
medication management alone, (2) combined medication management 
<BR>
and behavioral therapy, (3) behavioral treatment, and (4) 
<BR>
community care.  The average age of the children was eight and 
<BR>
80% were boys. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the study was to &quot;resolve controversies and 
<BR>
clinical quandaries about the relative value of medication and
<BR>
behavioral treatments&quot; (National Institute of Mental Health, 
<BR>
undated).  The proponents of the study claim that it demonstrated 
<BR>
the superiority of stimulant treatment over behavioral treatments 
<BR>
and routine community treatment.  However, an examination of the
<BR>
MTA study reveals that it was so grossly flawed methodologically 
<BR>
that it lacks scientific validity.  The following is a general 
<BR>
critique of the MTA study. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>I. The MTA was not a placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical 
<BR>
trial. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTA study fails to meet the commonly accepted criteria 
<BR>
for a scientific study of medication efficacy or effectiveness.  
<BR>
It was not a placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial (MTA 
<BR>
Cooperative Group, 1999a).  First, there was no placebo control 
<BR>
group and no non-treatment control group.  Second, to reach their
<BR>
conclusions, the investigators relied upon evaluations made by 
<BR>
teachers and parents who were not blind to the treatment.  That 
<BR>
is, the raters whom the investigators relied upon knew whether 
<BR>
or not the children were taking medication. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, the MTA was an &quot;open label&quot; study--the kind that 
<BR>
does not qualify as scientifically valid.  It could not be used,
<BR>
for example, for FDA approval of a drug.  Rater, researcher, and 
<BR>
subject biases, unconscious or conscious, influence the outcome 
<BR>
of &quot;open label&quot; studies.  Researchers commonly want to prove that 
<BR>
the treatment under investigation is effective, and in the case 
<BR>
of the MTA studies, all the principal investigators were staunch 
<BR>
advocates of medication.  Evaluators of efficacy are often 
<BR>
unconsciously influenced to perceive what they anticipate 
<BR>
perceiving, such as improvement in subjects treated with drugs.   
<BR>
Also, the subjects themselves often respond positively to please 
<BR>
their doctors or as a result of their belief that the drug will 
<BR>
help them.  Therefore, open label studies have been discredited 
<BR>
for purposes of studying efficacy.  As Nies and Spielberg (1996, 
<BR>
p. 45) observe, &quot;Placebo effects, which occur in a large percentage 
<BR>
of patients, can confound many studies--particularly those that 
<BR>
involve subject responses; controls must take this into account&quot; 
<BR>
(for additional discussions of  placebo, double-blind procedures, 
<BR>
and research standards, see Fisher and Greenberg, 1989). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>II. The blind classroom raters found no difference in any of 
<BR>
the treatment groups, i.e., behavioral interventions were equal 
<BR>
to medication interventions. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTA used one group of &quot;blinded ratings of school-based 
<BR>
ADHD and oppositional/aggressive symptoms...&quot; (MTA Cooperative 
<BR>
Group, 1999a, p. 1074).  The blind raters observed the children 
<BR>
in the classroom only.  The data from these raters are produced 
<BR>
in Table 5 (pp. 1082-3) of the study.  The blind raters found no 
<BR>
difference between any of the treatment groups on any of the 
<BR>
variables involving ADHD or oppositional behavior. However, this 
<BR>
extremely important finding, that the only potentially objective 
<BR>
raters found no drug effect, was given no importance in the study
<BR>
conclusions.  Nonetheless, the finding of the blind classroom 
<BR>
raters is one of the most important findings of the study, 
<BR>
confirming that stimulant drugs have no long-term positive effect. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>III. There was no control group of untreated children. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no non-treatment control group.  The MTA compared 
<BR>
various treatments, not treatment versus no treatment.  Two-thirds 
<BR>
of the community-treated group received a variety of medications, 
<BR>
as well as other interventions, and  therefore it cannot be 
<BR>
considered a non-treatment control group.  Basically, the studied 
<BR>
up compared three drug conditions to behavioral interventions, 
<BR>
without comparing the drug treatment to placebo. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>IV. Thirty-two percent of the Medication Management group was 
<BR>
already on medication for ADHD at the start of the MTA. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Table 3 (p. 1079) shows that of 144 medication management 
<BR>
subjects, 46 (32%) were on medication for ADHD at the start of 
<BR>
the selection process.  This is generally not acceptable in a 
<BR>
study of medication effects and corrupted the study.  Since the 
<BR>
children were already receiving medication, it is highly probably 
<BR>
that their parents had already determined to their own satisfaction 
<BR>
that the drugs were helpful.  Therefore they could not participate
<BR>
objectively in a &quot;random&quot; drug study. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>V. The Medication Management group was highly selective (in ways 
<BR>
that are not fully described) and probably not typical of children 
<BR>
who seek services for &quot;ADHD.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study initially screened 4,541 children.  These children 
<BR>
were referred from a variety of sources, such as public 
<BR>
advertisements, clinics, and schools.  The aim was to draw from 
<BR>
a broad spectrum of the kind of children whose parents bring them 
<BR>
for services for &quot;ADHD.&quot;  But of these 4,541 children, only 579 
<BR>
subjects (12.8%) were selected to enter the trials. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors do not clarify why so many children were rejected 
<BR>
from the study.  The small number of subjects actually selected for 
<BR>
the trials leaves a suspicion that the children in the trials do 
<BR>
not reflect a representative community group.  As already noted, 
<BR>
many of the children were already taking stimulant medications.   
<BR>
Overall, the group that entered the trials may have little relevance 
<BR>
to range of children who seek help in clinical practice. 
<BR>
<P>VI. The Medication Management group was relatively small. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual medical management group is much smaller than might 
<BR>
be suspected from the seemingly large scale of the study.  Of the 
<BR>
579 who entered the trials, only 144 entered medication management, 
<BR>
i.e., received medication alone.  Thirteen of these dropped out 
<BR>
before starting, limiting the actual start group to 131.  Eight 
<BR>
more dropped out during the study for a total of only 123 finishers 
<BR>
in medication management. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, of the 4,541 children originally screened, only 2.7 
<BR>
percent (123) completed the medication management trial. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, many of the children were comorbid for other 
<BR>
psychiatric diagnoses, so that the group of children diagnosed
<BR>
solely with ADHD was much smaller than the total of 123 finishers. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my experience reviewing scientific studies, it is unusual 
<BR>
for the trial cohort to be such a small sample of the original
<BR>
screened group.  Furthermore, the study was not nearly so large 
<BR>
as touted, with only 124 finishers in medication management and 
<BR>
even fewer children diagnosed solely with  ADHD in the medication 
<BR>
management group. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>VII. The children did not rate themselves improved. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children self-rated themselves on an anxiety scale (the 
<BR>
MASC, Table 5 in the study).  They did not rate themselves
<BR>
differently in any treatment category at any time.  Furthermore, 
<BR>
I received inside information that the children also rated 
<BR>
themselves on a depression scale.  This is confirmed by a handout 
<BR>
provided by the Columbia project (New York State Psychiatric 
<BR>
Institute and Columbia University Division of Child &amp; Adolescent 
<BR>
Psychiatry, 1994).  However, no data are reported in the study 
<BR>
concerning the depression scale. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stimulants commonly cause depression in children.  This 
<BR>
raises the question, &quot;Were the depression self-rating scales
<BR>
dropped because they indicated a worsening of the children's 
<BR>
condition?&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>VIII. Most of the subjects were boys. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Boys represent a disproportional number of the children who 
<BR>
are medicated with stimulants.  One reason is the demonstrated 
<BR>
usefulness of stimulants in suppressing overall normal spontaneous 
<BR>
behavior, thus making boys easier to manage under highly controlled
<BR>
circumstances (Breggin, 1999a&amp;b).  In part to counter the argument 
<BR>
that  stimulants are used for behavioral control of boys who are 
<BR>
being over-controlled in school, attempts have been made to 
<BR>
include more girls in studies.  Despite efforts to recruit more 
<BR>
girls, 80% of the subjects were boys, reconfirming that stimulants 
<BR>
are used to suppress the relatively higher activity rates of boys 
<BR>
compared to girls. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>IX.  Use of the Placebo Washout 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it is not clear how it was conducted, a placebo 
<BR>
washout was used, and subjects who responded to placebo were
<BR>
dropped from the study.  This technique skewed the study to 
<BR>
favor drug effects. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>X. Drug treatment was continuous for fourteen months; behavioral 
<BR>
treatments were stopped earlier. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTA is not a comparison study of drugs and behavioral 
<BR>
treatments at 14 months, since in the last few months, behavioral 
<BR>
treatments were spaced out to once a month or stopped.  Continuing 
<BR>
the drug treatment while discontinuing the behavioral treatment 
<BR>
gives the drug treatment an unfair advantage. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XI. The behavioral treatments were flawed. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study utilized behavioral treatments developed by Russell 
<BR>
A. Barkley.  Barkley has used these techniques for decades to try 
<BR>
to show that drugs are better than behavioral treatments.  He does 
<BR>
this by comparing drug treatment to his own type of behavioral 
<BR>
treatments.  Barkley's behavioral approach is doomed to failure 
<BR>
because it treats the child as a defective object suitable for 
<BR>
control by parents and teachers rather than as a sentient being 
<BR>
in conflict with adults at home and/or at school.  It ignores 
<BR>
everything that is known about family systems and the necessity 
<BR>
of changing the overall patterns of relationship in the family, 
<BR>
starting with the parents.  Nonetheless, these limited behavioral 
<BR>
approaches did as well as all the other treatments, according to 
<BR>
the only &quot;blind&quot; observers (see above). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XII.  Most children suffered from adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixty-four percent of children were reported to have some 
<BR>
ADRs, 11.4% moderate, 2.9% severe.  The authors of the study 
<BR>
dismiss the severe reactions because 6 of 11 were in the category 
<BR>
of &quot;depression, worrying, irritability.&quot;  They explain these 
<BR>
&quot;could have been due to nonmedication factors.&quot;  In reality, 
<BR>
placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials show depression, 
<BR>
worrying, and irritability are common stimulant ADRs (trials 
<BR>
reviewed in Breggin 1999a&amp;b). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XIII.  There were no trained observers for ADRS. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADRs were recorded on a two page check list by teachers 
<BR>
and parents.  There was no apparent training for this process. 
<BR>
In addition, parents and teachers were reassured in writing that 
<BR>
the drug was safe and that ADRs were not serious, thus creating 
<BR>
a bias.  Furthermore, many ADRs--such as behavioral suppression, 
<BR>
loss of spontaneity, apathy, and increased obsessive behavior-- 
<BR>
are seen as improvements by parents and teachers.  The use of 
<BR>
aware, experienced professionals, rather than parents and 
<BR>
teachers, is absolutely necessary in order to determine the 
<BR>
frequency and severity of ADRs (Borcherding, Keysor, Rapoport, 
<BR>
Elia, and Amass, 1990; studies reviewed in Breggin, 1999a&amp;b). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In clinical practice, I have found that asking children if 
<BR>
they are having adverse drug effects is a very important part of
<BR>
the assessment.  Often the child is having drug-related problems, 
<BR>
such as headaches or &quot;blah&quot; feelings, without realizing their
<BR>
source and without telling anyone.  The MTA study made no 
<BR>
specific effort to ask the children what drug effects they might 
<BR>
be experiencing. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, from the opening statement in the paper to its 
<BR>
conclusion, it is obvious that the investigators do not intend 
<BR>
to evaluate the single most important issue surrounding the long-
<BR>
term use of stimulant drugs--the risks they pose to the children. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XIV. There was no improvement in academic performance. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a note to Table 4 (MTA Cooperative  Group, 1999a,) the 
<BR>
authors of the MTA study admit there was no improvement or
<BR>
difference in academic performance in spelling or math.  The 
<BR>
table itself seems to indicate no improvement in reading as well. 
<BR>
Overall, no academic improvement was found as a result of any 
<BR>
treatment. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XV.  There was very little effect on social skills. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social skill differences among the groups were limited to 
<BR>
a significant difference favoring combined treatment over standard 
<BR>
community care.  Neither was better than behavioral or medical 
<BR>
management treatment (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999a). 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XVI. All the principal investigators were well-known drug advocates. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could so many experienced professionals produce such an 
<BR>
unscientific study?  The framer of the studies, Peter Jensen (then 
<BR>
at NIMH), and all the principal investigators are avid drug 
<BR>
advocates who have been touting the positive results of the study 
<BR>
even before the study was completed or published.  The six principal
<BR>
investigators included Laurence Greenhill, C. K. Conners, William 
<BR>
Pelham, Howard Abikoff, James Swanson, and Stephen Hinshaw (MTA 
<BR>
Cooperative Group, 1999am, p. 1077). They have devoted their lives 
<BR>
to encouraging the concept of ADHD and the drugging of children.  
<BR>
Some, like Conners, have been doing so for four decades. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurence Greenhill of the New York State Psychiatric Institute 
<BR>
and Columbia University represents the kind of conflict of interest 
<BR>
that exists among MTA researchers.  Although it was later removed 
<BR>
amid controversy over research on children at the institute, the 
<BR>
New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University website 
<BR>
listed the funding of its researchers as of December 21, 1998 (NYSPI
<BR>
Sponsored Research, 1998).  Greenhill had research funds or other 
<BR>
financial support from six drug companies: Richwood, Bristol-Myers, 
<BR>
Solvay, Wyeth-Ayerst, Glaxo, and Eli Lilly. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XVII. The parents and teachers were exposed to prodrug propaganda. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The families and teachers were exposed to the pro-drug biases 
<BR>
of these investigators in the materials given to them before they 
<BR>
enrolled in the study.  The &quot;Teacher Information&quot; for the MTA study 
<BR>
presents the usual claims about how much harm ADHD causes children 
<BR>
(NIMH MTA Study, undated, a).  It states the children will be 
<BR>
treated with a &quot;safe and effective dose of medication...&quot; [bold in
<BR>
original].  This kind of built-in bias has no place in a study that 
<BR>
used the teachers to rate safety and efficacy. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;Information for Parents&quot; handout had similar built-in 
<BR>
biases, including a reference to biochemical imbalances and genetic 
<BR>
factors in &quot;ADHD&quot; (NIMH MTA Study, undated, a).  In fact, based on 
<BR>
the information handouts given out by Columbia and the NYSPI for 
<BR>
the MTA, the parents in this study were not given informed consent 
<BR>
for the risks posed to their children by the drugs. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>XVIII. Use of Intent-to-treat Analyses 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve an apparent superiority of for medication
<BR>
management over behavioral treatment and community care, the study 
<BR>
employed &quot;intent-to-treat analyses&quot; (MTA Cooperative Group, 1999b).  
<BR>
This method uses data from patients who have dropped out of the 
<BR>
study.  For example, a patient who drops out because of adverse 
<BR>
drug reactions could be counted as successful if, on his or her 
<BR>
last visit, a positive evaluation was reported.  This misleading 
<BR>
method is used when an analysis of the actual finishers of a study 
<BR>
fails to obtain the result that is sought after by the investigators. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<P>Discussion 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MTA study has been highly promoted by advocates of drug 
<BR>
therapy as a demonstration of the superiority of stimulant treatment 
<BR>
for ADHD.  In fact, the study failed to meet the basic scientific 
<BR>
criteria for a drug trial.  It was not placebo-controlled and in 
<BR>
fact had no non-treatment control group.  It was not double blind.  
<BR>
Teachers and parents provided the ratings relied upon by the study, 
<BR>
but both groups knew whether or not the children were taking 
<BR>
medications.  The MTA study was &quot;open label&quot; and would not have 
<BR>
qualified, for example, as a study for the FDA-approval process.  
<BR>
As research, it is scientifically unsound. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the blind raters in the study who observed 
<BR>
behavior in the classroom found no differences over fourteen 
<BR>
months in any of the treatment conditions.  In other words, the 
<BR>
observations generated by the most objective observers confirms 
<BR>
that there was the medicated children did not better than the 
<BR>
other children in the study.  Unfortunately, the MTA study also 
<BR>
failed to examine the kind of interventions that, in actual 
<BR>
clinical practice, prove very effective in helping children 
<BR>
labeled with ADHD.  These interventions include individualized 
<BR>
family counseling aimed at improving relationships in the family 
<BR>
and individualized educational approaches that inspire children 
<BR>
to engage themselves in school (Breggin, 1998, 2000). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, the MTA study failed to adhere to basic standards 
<BR>
for scientific studies of medication efficacy and cannot be used 
<BR>
to draw any valid conclusions.  Furthermore, the data it generated 
<BR>
tends to indicate that stimulant medication produced no different 
<BR>
results than any of the other intervention.  The MTA study does 
<BR>
not demonstrate the superiority, or even the usefulness, of 
<BR>
stimulant medication in the treatment of children labeled with 
<BR>
ADHD or any other presumed psychiatric disorder.
