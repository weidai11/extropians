Subject: FDA Attacks The Internet
<BR>
<P>FDA SEEKS TO DESTROY ALTERNATIVE  HEALTH  WEB SITES
<BR>
<P>By William Faloon
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA's history is one of incompetence, fraud, deceit and the
<BR>
continuous striving for more power. Over the past 25 years, the Food and
<BR>
Drug Administration has sought to gain authoritarian control that Congress
<BR>
never intended it to have. In every attempt to seize this kind of power,
<BR>
the FDA has been beaten back by a swell of public protest.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA has just launched a disinformation campaign to deceive
<BR>
Congress into believing that the agency needs to &quot;protect&quot; the public from
<BR>
health information on the Internet. The FDA is seeking ten million tax
<BR>
dollars a year to attack alternative health and pharmacy web sites. If the
<BR>
FDA convinces Congress to give it the power and money to do this, American
<BR>
consumers will be denied access to innovative therapies, and will be
<BR>
forced to pay a good deal more for the nutrient and drug therapies the FDA
<BR>
allows them to buy over the Internet.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the FDA's proposals is to be able to fine Internet
<BR>
pharmacies $500,000 every time they dispense a drug without a prescription
<BR>
authorized by the agency. With this kind of excessive fining power, the
<BR>
FDA will be able to bankrupt any online pharmacy it targets. To make it
<BR>
easy for them to shut down large numbers of web sites, the FDA wants the
<BR>
power to issue subpoenas without first obtaining a court order, a
<BR>
totalitarian tactic the American public revolted against when the agency
<BR>
proposed it in 1990. Finally, the FDA says it wants to set up &quot;a rapid
<BR>
response team&quot; to identify, investigate, and prosecute web sites.  In
<BR>
other words, the FDA is seeking to establish an army of cyberspace
<BR>
storm-troopers to enable it to shut down large numbers of web sites
<BR>
quickly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alleged purpose of these new powers is to &quot;target and
<BR>
punish those who engage in illegal drug sales over the Internet.&quot; This may
<BR>
sound reasonable to the average person, but as members of The Life
<BR>
Extension Foundation well know, the FDA's history is one of ineptitude and
<BR>
corruption that has caused millions of Americans to suffer and die
<BR>
needlessly. In 1994, the FDA Museum was established to document FDA
<BR>
malfeasance, and show that the agency hasn't the scientific legitimacy to
<BR>
be allowed to police the healthcare of the American people.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A flagrant example of FDA deception can be found in their current
<BR>
attempt to control the Internet. The FDA has identified one person who
<BR>
died after obtaining Viagra from a Web pharmacy without a prescription.
<BR>
The FDA is using this one death as an example of why the FDA needs to
<BR>
impose dictatorial power over all health Web sites. One problem with this
<BR>
position is that, as of November 1998, at least 130 Americans died from
<BR>
taking Viagra legally prescribed by their doctors. (The total number of
<BR>
Viagra-related deaths for 1999 has not yet been calculated.) The FDA
<BR>
approved Viagra as being safe, even though many Americans have died when
<BR>
the drug has been legally prescribed. The FDA failed to detect this lethal
<BR>
side effect of Viagra, yet it is now seeking gestapo-like power to attack
<BR>
any Internet health company it wishes to, without due process. It's time
<BR>
for the public to speak up again to let Congress know that this kind of
<BR>
FDA tyranny will not be tolerated by tax payers.
<BR>
<P>Why Internet Regulation is Doomed to Fail
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers the FDA is seeking are unconstitutional, and the
<BR>
agency has neither the competence nor the integrity to police the
<BR>
Internet, but even if it did, it would be impractical for the agency to do
<BR>
so. There are currently an estimated 8,000 health sites on the Internet.
<BR>
If Congress gives the FDA $10 million a year, the best the agency could do
<BR>
is shut down a couple of hundred sites a year. Within a few years, the FDA
<BR>
would create a  litigation monster whose appetite would far exceed their
<BR>
$10 million annual budget. The FDA would be bogged down in a quagmire of
<BR>
judicial proceedings, while thousands of new health Web sites would be
<BR>
springing up that the agency would be at an utter loss to control.  The
<BR>
end result of the FDA's war against the free flow of information on the
<BR>
Internet would be tens of millions of tax dollars wasted, with less
<BR>
so-called consumer &quot;protection&quot; than exists today.
<BR>
<P>The FDA Already Has The Legal Power It Needs
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charade the FDA is parading before Congress is that they
<BR>
need more money and stricter laws to regulate e-commerce. The facts are
<BR>
that the FDA already has the regulatory structure to &quot;protect&quot; the
<BR>
consumer on the Internet. Much of what the FDA wants is already covered by
<BR>
existing Federal and State law, but the agency is seeking to add another
<BR>
bureaucratic layer of law and money to suppress the dissemination of
<BR>
health information.
<BR>
<P>An Alternative Proposal
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA has its own Web site (www.fda.gov) For a fraction of the
<BR>
cost of becoming the health police of the Internet police, the agency
<BR>
could post its own evaluation of alternative health Web sites that it
<BR>
thought were promoting fraudulent or dangerous products. Americans would
<BR>
then be free to make their own decisions about whether to believe what the
<BR>
FDA says about health web sites.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the FDA has no interest in trying to persuade Americans
<BR>
with evidence. It wants (and has always wanted) authoritarian powers and
<BR>
as much money as possible from Congress because it is a political
<BR>
organization rather than a scientific one.  As a result, FDA suppression
<BR>
of information has been, historically, the leading cause of death in the
<BR>
United States, while adverse reactions to FDA approved drugs is currently
<BR>
the 4th-to-6th leading cause of death. Clearly, the FDA lacks the
<BR>
constitutional authority, the competence, the integrity or the scientific
<BR>
credibility to be given additional power and money to police the Internet.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;A History of Victories Over the FDA
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Federal Courts, Congress and the public have dealt the FDA
<BR>
severe losses over the past 25 years.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first citizens' victory occurred in the 1970's when the FDA
<BR>
tried to turn vitamin supplements into prescription drugs. An uproar from
<BR>
the public resulted in Congress unanimously rejecting FDA's brazen
<BR>
arguments that vitamins are so &quot;dangerous&quot; that they should only be
<BR>
prescribed by doctors.  This blatant power grab came at a time when the
<BR>
vast majority of doctors had little or no knowledge of the health benefits
<BR>
of vitamins.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990, the FDA tried to have a law passed that would have
<BR>
enabled the agency to make summary seizures of products from companies,
<BR>
and institute wire taps without a court warrant. The public again defended
<BR>
the Bill of Rights by inundating Congress with so much mail that the FDA's
<BR>
proposed law was abandoned.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1993, the FDA stated that it wanted to classify all amino
<BR>
acids and many minerals as prescription drugs. The public expressed such a
<BR>
high degree of outrage over the FDA's draconian proposition, that Congress
<BR>
passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (in 1994) that
<BR>
significantly limited the FDA's authority to regulate dietary supplements.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994, the FDA has circumvented the will of the people and
<BR>
Congress by seeking to censor what the public is allowed to hear about
<BR>
supplements and drugs. The FDA has been defeated repeatedly in the counts,
<BR>
and has been forced to retreat because of an onslaught of public
<BR>
opposition to all forms of censorship the agency has proposed.
<BR>
<P>Orwellian Computer Robots
<BR>
<P>A nightmare scenario sometimes portrayed in science fiction novels
<BR>
involves a totalitarian government using advanced computers to monitor the
<BR>
activities of citizens. In these novels, people who don't behave according
<BR>
to government standards are targeted for persecution or summary
<BR>
elimination.
<BR>
<P>The Orwellian prophesy is becoming reality as the FDA is proposing to
<BR>
spend a million dollars a year on artificial intelligence computer robots
<BR>
that would scan the Internet for phrases such as &quot;prevents cancer&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;prescription drug&quot; so the FDA could &quot;swiftly gather the information
<BR>
needed to prosecute.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The new law the FDA is proposing would mandate that on-line pharmacies
<BR>
first receive FDA-approval to operate. Pharmacies are currently regulated
<BR>
by the States, but the FDA is seeking to impose a new Federal bureaucratic
<BR>
layer that will greatly increase the cost of purchasing products on the
<BR>
Internet.
<BR>
<P>The FDA needs to convince Congress that American citizens should be
<BR>
subjected to Orwellian investigative tactics and that tax payer dollars
<BR>
should be appropriated to pay for these Web robots to assist the FDA in
<BR>
detecting words it does not want Americans to read.
<BR>
<P>American citizens who cherish their Constitutional rights against undue
<BR>
government intrusion should contact their members of Congress and demand
<BR>
that the FDA not be given the money, nor the legal authority to control
<BR>
the Internet. This is more than just a health freedom issue. The FDA's
<BR>
Orwellian proposals are unprecedented and would create lead to a serious
<BR>
breakdown of our civil liberties if enacted into law.
<BR>
<P>Just Tell Congress To Say &quot;No&quot; to The FDA
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA is using the free-flowing popularity of the Internet in a
<BR>
ploy to deceive Congress into appropriating ten million tax dollars a year
<BR>
to fund an unconstitutional witch hunt against free speech. The new powers
<BR>
the FDA is seeking are blatantly un-American and resemble the kinds of
<BR>
police-state tactics employed by totalitarian regimes such as communist
<BR>
China.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA's latest fabrication will fail if Americans tell their
<BR>
Congressional representatives to say NO to any new proposal or law that
<BR>
would give the FDA more power or money. Included in this message is a

FDA's latest attempt to gain repressive power over the individual's right

<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20515
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fiscal Year 2001 budget to be submitted by the Executive
<BR>
Branch of the government contains a provision whereby the Food and Drug
<BR>
Administration (FDA) is to be appropriated ten million dollars a year to
<BR>
police the Internet. I am vehemently opposed to my tax dollars being used
<BR>
to fund the FDA for this purpose.  I believe that additional FDA power and
<BR>
funding would be used to deprive the American people of valuable health
<BR>
information and health products.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the FY 2001 budget proposal, the FDA is asking Congress to
<BR>
pass new law that would give the agency repressive powers that would
<BR>
restrict the free flow of information on the Internet. I ask that you vote
<BR>
against any proposed law that gives the FDA more control over what I am
<BR>
allowed to read and put into my body. Some of the unconstitutional
<BR>
authority the FDA is seeking includes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Issuing subpoenas without a court order. Giving the FDA
<BR>
this new power is unconstitutional, and would will create a litigation
<BR>
monster whose annual appetite would rapidly exceed the ten million dollars
<BR>
a year the agency is seeking.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Fining Internet pharmacies $500,000.00 every time they
<BR>
sell a drug that does not meet the FDA's definition of a legal
<BR>
prescription. This type of excessive fine would enable the FDA to bankrupt
<BR>
any online pharmacy it decides to target in a capricious and arbitrary
<BR>
manner.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Setting up &quot;a rapid response team&quot; to identify,
<BR>
investigate, and prosecute Web sites, i.e., the FDA is seeking to
<BR>
establish an army of storm-troopers to summarily shut down any web site it
<BR>
chooses.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please do not be misled by the FDA's attempts to convince you
<BR>
that they are trying to protect the health of the American people by
<BR>
regulating the Internet. According to the April 15, 1998 issue of the
<BR>
Journal of the American Medical Association, adverse reactions to legally
<BR>
prescribed FDA-approved drugs are the fourth-to-sixth leading cause of
<BR>
death in the United States. Since this article was published almost two
<BR>
years ago, the FDA has done nothing to reduce the number of Americans
<BR>
dying from dangerous drugs, yet the FDA now seeks ten million tax dollars
<BR>
a year to attack health and pharmacy Web sites.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the FDA convinces Congress to grant it more power and money to
<BR>
attack health web sites, American consumers will be denied access to
<BR>
innovative therapies and pay a lot more for their prescription drugs.  I
<BR>
therefore ask that you write to me with your position on this issue so I
<BR>
will know how to cast my ballot when you up for election.
