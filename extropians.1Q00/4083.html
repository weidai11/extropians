<P>Subject: Re: I'm happy to hear the surgery went well!!
<BR>
<P>To James Swayze,
<BR>
Based on recent posts I assume you have some kind of bone cancer.
<BR>
Let me draw your attention to <A HREF="http://www.gerson.org/">http://www.gerson.org/</A>
<BR>
The Gerson therapy has a 30-40 percent success rate in healing cancer.
<BR>
If you can afford to I suggest you buy a Norwalk juicer or at least a
<BR>
champion juicer, and start drinking fresh squeezed organic juices every
<BR>
waking hour!
<BR>
Coffee enemas every 4 hours are important too, as is the rest of the
<BR>
therapy.
<BR>
(Unless you have taken chemo theraphy, in which case it is important to
<BR>
first consult one of the doctor's trained in the Gerson therapy and start a
<BR>
little easier with the juices etc. not to get into kidney failure.)

<P>There are lots of more seaworthy vessels than barges.
The better cruise ships, are built to take on  the Atlantic during storms.

<P>&gt;THe problem not answered by these sovereign-sea schemes is that to protect
&gt;from storms you will HAVE to build a significant seawall of some type to
&gt;attenuate wave action, or else have solid anchored structures seated on the
&gt;seamounts (like oil rigs) to be relatively impervious to them. A barge is
not a
&gt; very seaworthy vessel.
<P>Many sovereign-sea projects are inflexible stationary schemes,
that easily can be stopped or taken over by the nearest land based nations.
It always amazes me that people will set themselves up to be blackmailed by
government that way, when there is a well tested alternative that has
worked well for centuries:  Mobility.
<P>With ocean going ships, ship owners can flag their ships under most any
nation.
This gives an extreme leverage against any government, and is the reason why
taxes on ship owners often are low or non existent.
This is also the reason for the many freeports where ships can enter without
paying customs, and where the crew members can shop duty free.
To attract ships and trade, nations have been forced to treat ship owners
quite libertarian.
<P>The ability to flag out, gives the ship owner very good leverage to
negotiate
with various nations so to find one willing to give him the best legal
conditions to operate under.
Admirality law has traditionally given the captain almost free reigns as to
what laws to enforce on board his ship.
<P>Strange that run of the mill libertarians have not caught on and used this
opportunity to negotiate with the worlds nations so to see which will give
them the most libertarian legal conditions. Actually ship owners have caught
on a long time ago, but though there are libertarian ship owners they
haven't until recently started considering making their own liberty
available for others as well.
see:  <A HREF="http://www.residensea.com/">http://www.residensea.com/</A>
The first ship is fully financed and already under construction
and will be off on its maiden voyage within two years.
It is only for millionairs.
But if the demand is there, someone will certainly create a version for the
lower classes as well.
<P> &gt; Don't float those things north of Oz; those precious, government free
 &gt; international waters are full of pirates. That's the torture &amp; kill
everyone
 &gt; aboard and take all the stuff kind, not the more harmless peg leg &amp;
parrot
 &gt; variety.
<P>Bullshit. (or propaganda used to frighten the sheeps back to obediently
obeying their government.)
Norway has been one of the worlds largest seagoing nations for several
centuries now, and pirates is something we hear about as rarely as people
being hit by lightning.
There are some pirates in the Far East and off Africa, and Norwegian boats
have had to take meassures to fend off such, but in the North Atlantic
pirates are an endangered species.
Most pirate incidents are attacks on bulk ships, where a few crew members
easily can be overwhelmed by a handful men.
Cruise ships on the other hand have a crew of several hundred or often more
than a thousand men, and can easily be defended in an orderly fashion.
Maybe that is why they are so rarely attacked by pirates.
I think there was one attack off India/Africa some time ago, but such are
rare
and can easily be prevented.
<P>&gt;Sounds like they need some attitude adjustment. Just the place for
&gt;techno-libertarians...
<P>&gt; &gt; But then I forget that a lot of you guys are relatively heavily armed.
<P>&gt;Si.
<P>&gt; &gt; There's some kind of endpoint to this libertarian extremism, where
&gt; &gt; international waters hold exactly as many libertarians as can be
squeezed
&gt; &gt; in, without any one seeing the others (others are always over the
horizon).
&gt; &gt; Each person sits on his/her personal barge, fully armed with all many of
&gt; &gt; ballistic weapons. Scanner (radar?) continually scan 360 degrees, and
launch
&gt; &gt; missiles, etc at anything that moves. Sounds like a really bad movie.
&gt; &gt; Waterworld?
<P>You don't have to start your own nation or army to get liberty at sea.
All you have to do is to shop around to see what nation that most eagerly
will let you incorporate a ship under your own libertarian charter.
Many nations eagerly set up freeports to attract trade and business.
And traditionally many nations let the ship owners and captains run their
own ships any way they please. Many nations are just happy that the ships
are flagged
under their flag, and they are underbidding one another to attract ships.
The idea seems to be that it is better to earn a small amount from many
ships than to price oneself out of the market and earn nothing.
Being flagged under an existing well esteemed nation, gets you instant
protection from being attacked by uncle Sam and other war mongers.
And in case of wars one can most often sail off. Most ocean going Norwegian
ships escaped being captured last time Norway was invaded (by the Germans in
1940).
<P>&gt;Anyone anchored on a seamount stakes claim to an undersea
&gt;structure (as well as surrounding abyssal plains full of metallic nodes)
&gt; that is a gold mine to those who develop it wisely. Costner doesn't
understand &gt; this, which is why all of his WW extras looked so Dickensian.
<P>With satelite communications, and internet, I think there is a larger
potential
in creative work and research and in the ability to build and operate a boat
without having to deal with taxes, zoning laws, majority rule and other
regulations,
<P>&gt;Since dwellers would not pay taxes to a government, they could afford quite
&gt;reasonable armaments on the open market. Those that get hair trigger wind
up
&gt;getting snuffed by those who want to live peacably.
<P>Most ship owners prefer to spend their money on more boats, or on yachts,
huge residences, vacations and other luxory, but I guess if anyone wants to
voluntary spend it on weapons, when they don't have to...it is a free
country.

&gt;I would be interested to know what Trygve B. Bauge would have to tell us
&gt;regarding this matter since he is a leader in the area of developing
&gt;independant communities on the open seas.
<P>Traditionally cruise ships have been a kind of socialistic welfare states,
where the cruise company owns everything and all the passengers get
everything during the cruise as part of their ticket.
<P>I have been promoting the privatization of cruise ships for about 6 years
now.
By calling for the creation of cruise ships where each suite is sold and
owned separately. A kind of floating town ships.
One Norwegian group of ship owners have recently targeted the millionair
market
and will be up and sailing such a floating village within 2 years.
<P>The same concept can be used for those of us that are not millionaires as
well:
The idea is to buy an old cruise ship (Ships are written down (paid off) in
a few years and older ships are available far cheaper than it costs to build
new ones.) Subdivide it into individual lots and  sell off these. Instead of
huge &amp; fancy restaurants one could have McDonalds and private grocery
stores, and instead of large suites &amp; room service one could have youth
hostels and laundromats etc,
all owned by separate individual entrepreneurs.
<P>Ships do not stay sea worthy for ever.
But most larger harbours have tax free, free ports, such a ship could
easily be anchored near such free ports for an extended life..
And with all the freeports that are around it should be possible to
negotiate
a final anchor place that respects liberty.
In the mean time each ship can sail a generation or two on the seven seas.
And one can of course move on to newer ships.
Ship owners typically make enough money on their ships to scrap these
and buy new ships long before the older ship is worn out.
There is nothing to prevent inhabitants of a floating village from making
enough money to move on to newer ships every few years as well.

&gt;&gt;A challenge for the next century!Introduction: On February the 28th, 2000,
&gt;&gt;it was 100 years since the birth of my grandfather Bredo Morstøl,

&gt;&gt;for 10 years.

<P>&gt;I was very impressed by the scope of your vision and hopes for the future
of
&gt;society.  I liked the focus on personal freedom to travel and emergency
&gt;preparedness.  You could be the father of the survivalist/transhumanist
&gt;movement! :)
<P>&gt;Congratulations to your grandfather for being suspended.  perhaps, one day
I
&gt;will get to meet him in the flesh!  What organization is maintaining him
&gt;while in suspension?
I have built a terrain integrated, earth quake proof, storm proof and fire
proof
house in the Colorado Rockies. He is stored on our property there in a dry
ice box. And we have hired a local entrepreneur to add 900 lbs of dry ice
every 3 weeks.

&gt;&gt;And let us be sure our constitutional charter makes it a punishable felony

&gt;&gt;(end)
<P>John Grigg responded:
&gt;To me this would be a violation of a person's right to stand up for what
&gt;they view is right.  I could never agree with this.
<P>What I had in mind was an amendment like the first amendment:
&quot;Government shall make no law regarding individual life-extension or the
free pursuit there of.&quot;
Basically it is a crime, unconstitutional and a transgression of one's power
for a government to try to pass or enforce laws that violate the first
amendment.
Only a federal constitutional amendment and not a mere bill or law is what
that is needed to take away this liberty, and local or state governments can
not take it away on their own at all.
I would like to protect cryonics and human cloning the same way that free
speech has been protected. And to award full compensation, punitive damages,
cost or even tripple damages to anyone who's life-extension rights have been
violated by government.
<P>What I meant was to make it a punishable felony to attempt to outlaw
cryonics and human cloning in any other way than through a constitutional
amendment.
At the same time I would like to put in place so many constitutional checks
and balances that it will take several hundred years before the majority or
any special interest group can manage to take away this right.
<P>&gt;Anyway, welcome to the list.  I hope the world takes on the shape you
&gt;envision.  I want to learn more about the communities on the high sea's you
&gt;are developing.
<P>Stay tuned a few years down the road.
I am working on completing a constitutional charter that enumerates
Entrepreneurial liberty as a set of universal unalienable rights.
And would like to complete the latter before I turn a cruise ship into an
affordable floating village.
<P>I hope that someone else will jump on the idea and implement it, so that I
don't have to implement it myself.  There are always enough life-extending
challenges.
That is why I am grateful to the Resident sea people for implementing
the floating village idea. I am not involved in their project. But I have
been promoting the concept for many years now, and it is nice to see that
someone
finally is implementing it.

<P>I haven't checked the above web site yet, but super cooled super conductors

pollution free gas powered power plant is built here in Norway.
It will produce enormous amounts of inexpensive industrial liquid coolants
liquid Nitrogen and liquid carbondioxide.
