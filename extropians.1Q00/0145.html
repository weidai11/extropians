<P>IDEOLOGICAL FREEWARE: DISTRIBUTE AT WILL
<BR>
<P>The Manifesto of January 3, 2000
<BR>
<P><P>In 1914, the lamps went out all over Europe.
<BR>
Life during the rest of the twentieth century was
<BR>
like crouching under a rock.
<BR>
<P>But human life is not required to be like the
<BR>
twentieth century. That wasn앖 fate, it was merely
<BR>
a historical circumstance. In this new Belle Epoque,
<BR>
this delightful era, we are experiencing a prolonged break
<BR>
in the last century압 even tenor of mayhem. The time has
<BR>
come to step out of those shadows into a different
<BR>
cultural reality.
<BR>
<P>We need a sense of revived possibility, of genuine
<BR>
creative potential, of unfeigned joie de vivre. We have a
<BR>
new economy, but we have no new intelligentsia. We have
<BR>
massive flows of information and capital, but we have a
<BR>
grave scarcity of meaning. We know what we can buy, but
<BR>
we don앖 know what we want.
<BR>
<P>The twentieth century featured any number of -isms.
<BR>
They were fatally based on the delusion that philosophy
<BR>
trumps engineering. It doesn앖. In a world fully
<BR>
competent to command its material basis, ideology is
<BR>
inherently flimsy. &quot;Technology&quot; in its broad sense:
<BR>
the ability to transform resources, the speed at which new
<BR>
possibilities can be opened and exploited, the multiple
<BR>
and various forms of command-and-control -- technology,
<BR>
not ideology, is the twentieth century압 lasting legacy.
<BR>
Technology broke the gridlock of the five-decade Cold War.
<BR>
It made a new era thinkable. And, finally, technology
<BR>
made a new era obvious.
<BR>
<P>But too many twentieth-century technologies
<BR>
are very like twentieth-century ideologies: rigid,
<BR>
monolithic, poisonous and non-sustainable.
<BR>
<P>We need clean, supple, healthy means of support for
<BR>
a crowded world. We need recyclable technologies,
<BR>
industries that don앖 take themselves with that
<BR>
Stalinesque seriousness that demands the brutal sacrifice
<BR>
of millions. In order to make flimsy, supple technologies
<BR>
thinkable, and then achievable, then finally obvious, we
<BR>
need an ideology that embraces its own obsolescence.
<BR>
<P>The immediate future won앖 be a period suitable for
<BR>
building monuments, establishing thousand-year regimes,
<BR>
creating new-model citizens, or asserting leaden
<BR>
certainties about anything whatsoever. The immediate
<BR>
future is about picking and choosing among previously
<BR>
unforeseen technical potentials.
<BR>
<P>Our time calls for intelligent fads. Our time calls
<BR>
for a self-aware, highly temporary array of broad social
<BR>
experiments, whose effects are localized, non-lethal and
<BR>
reversible -- yet transparent, and visible to all parties
<BR>
who might be persuaded to look.
<BR>
<P>The Internet is the natural test-bed for this
<BR>
fast-moving, fast-vanishing, start-up society. Because
<BR>
the native technology of the coming years is not the 19th
<BR>
century &quot;machine&quot; or the 20th century &quot;product.&quot; It is
<BR>
the 21st century &quot;gizmo.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A gizmo is a device with so many features and so
<BR>
many promises that it can never be mastered within its
<BR>
own useful lifetime. A gizmo is flimsy, cheap, colorful,
<BR>
friendly, intriguing, easily disposable, and unlikely to
<BR>
harm the user. The gizmo압 purpose is not to
<BR>
efficiently perform some function or effectively provide
<BR>
some service. A gizmo exists to snag the user압
<BR>
attention, and to engage the user in a vast
<BR>
unfolding nexus of interlinked experience.
<BR>
<P>The gizmo in its manifold aspects is the beau ideal
<BR>
for contemporary design and engineering. Because that is
<BR>
what our culture will be like, at its heart, in its bones,
<BR>
in its organs. A gizmo culture. We will go in so many
<BR>
directions at once that most of them will never see
<BR>
fulfillment. And then they will be gone.
<BR>
<P>This is confusing and seems lacking in moral
<BR>
seriousness -- but only only by the rigid standards of
<BR>
the past century, bitterly obsessed with ultimate
<BR>
efficiencies and malignant final solutions. We need
<BR>
opportunities now, not efficiencies. We need inspired
<BR>
improvisation, not solutions. Technology can no longer
<BR>
bind us in a vast tonnage of iron, barbed wire and brick.
<BR>
We will stop heaving balky machines uphill. Instead, we
<BR>
begin judging entire techno-complexes as they virtually
<BR>
unfold, judging them by standards that are, in some very
<BR>
basic sense, aesthetic.
<BR>
<P>Henceforth, it is humans and human flesh that lasts
<BR>
out the years, not the mechanical infrastructure. Our
<BR>
bodies outlast our machines, and our bodies outlast our
<BR>
beliefs. People will outlive this &quot;revolution&quot; -- if
<BR>
spared an apocalypse, human individuals will outlive every
<BR>
&quot;technology&quot; that we are capable of deploying. Waves of
<BR>
techno-change will come faster and faster, and with less
<BR>
and less permanent consequence. Waves will be arriving
<BR>
with the somnolent regularity of Waikiki breakers. This
<BR>
&quot;revolution&quot; does not replace one social order with
<BR>
another. It replaces social order with an array of further
<BR>
possible transformations.
<BR>
<P>Since gizmos are easily outmoded and inherently
<BR>
impermanent, their most graceful form is as disposable
<BR>
consumer technology. We should embrace those gizmos that
<BR>
are pleasing, abject, humble, and closest to the human
<BR>
body. We should spurn those that are remote, difficult,
<BR>
threatening, poisonous and brittle.
<BR>
<P>Most of all, we must never, ever again feel awestruck
<BR>
wonder about any manufactured device. They don앖 last,
<BR>
and are not worthy of that form of respect.
<BR>
<P>We must engage with technology in a new way, from a
<BR>
fresh perspective. The arts traditionally hold this
<BR>
critical position. The arts are in a position today to
<BR>
inspire a burst of cultural vitality across the board.
<BR>
The times are very propitious for the arts. There압 a
<BR>
profound restlessness, there압 money loose, there are new
<BR>
means of display and communication, and the nouveau riche
<BR>
have nothing to wear and nothing that suits their walls.
<BR>
It압 a golden opportunity for techno-dandyism.
<BR>
<P>Artists, don앖 be afraid of commercialization. The
<BR>
sovereign remedy for commercialization is not for artists
<BR>
to hide from commerce. That can앖 be done any more, and
<BR>
in any case, hiding never wins and strong artists don앖
<BR>
live in fear.
<BR>
<P>Instead, we have a new remedy available. The
<BR>
aggressive counter-action to commodity totalitarianism is
<BR>
to give things away. Not other people압 property -- that
<BR>
would be, sad to say, &quot;piracy&quot; -- but the products of your
<BR>
own imagination, your own creative effort.
<BR>
<P>This is the time to be thoughtful, be expressive, be
<BR>
generous. Be &quot;taken advantage of.&quot; The channels exist
<BR>
now to give creativity away, at no cost, to millions.
<BR>
Never mind if you make large sums of money along the way.
<BR>
If you successfully seize attention, nothing is more
<BR>
likely. In a start-up society, huge sums can fall on
<BR>
innocent parties, almost by accident. That cannnot be
<BR>
helped, so don앖 worry about it any more. Henceforth,
<BR>
artistic integrity should be judged, not by one압 classic
<BR>
bohemian seclusion from satanic mills and the grasping
<BR>
bourgeoisie, but by what one creates and gives away.
<BR>
That is the only scale of noncommercial integrity that
<BR>
makes any sense now.
<BR>
<P>Freedom has to be won, and, more importantly, the
<BR>
consequences of freedom have to be lived. You do not win
<BR>
freedom of information by filching data from a corporate
<BR>
warehouse, or begging the authorities to kindly abandon
<BR>
their monopolies, copyrights and patents. You have to
<BR>
create that freedom by a deliberate act of will, think it
<BR>
up, assemble it, sacrifice for it, make it free to others
<BR>
who have a similar will to live that freedom.
<BR>
<P>Ivory towers are no longer in order. We need ivory
<BR>
networks. Today, sitting quietly and thinking is the
<BR>
world압 greatest generator of wealth and prosperity.
<BR>
Moguls spend their lives sitting in chairs, staring into
<BR>
screens, and occasionally clicking a mouse. Though we
<BR>
didn앖 expect it, were all on the same net. We no longer
<BR>
need feudal shelters to protect us from the swords and
<BR>
torches of barbarian ignorance. So show them words and
<BR>
images: make it obvious, let them look. If theyre
<BR>
interested, fine; if not, go pick another website.
<BR>
<P>The structure of human intellectual achievement
<BR>
should be reformatted, so that any human being with a
<BR>
sincere interest can learn as much as possible, as rapidly
<BR>
as their abilities allow. The Internet is the greatest
<BR>
accomplishment of the twentieth century압 scientific
<BR>
community, and the Internet has made a new intelligentsia
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>Like the scientific method, the Internet is a
<BR>
genuine, workable, verifiable means of intellectual
<BR>
liberation. Don앖 worry if it압 not universal. Awareness
<BR>
can앖 be doled out like soup, or sold like soap.
<BR>
Intellectual vitality is an inherently internal, self-
<BR>
actualizing process. The net must make this possible
<BR>
for people, not by blasting flags and gospel at the
<BR>
masses, but by opening doors for individual minds, who
<BR>
will then pursue their own interests.
<BR>
<P>This can be made to happen. It is quite near to us
<BR>
now, the trends favor it. The consequences of genuine
<BR>
intellectual freedom are literally and rightfully
<BR>
unimaginable. But the unimaginable is the right thing to
<BR>
do. The unimaginable is far better than perfection,
<BR>
because perfection can never be achieved, and it would
<BR>
kill us if it were. Whereas the &quot;unimaginable&quot; is, at
<BR>
its root, merely a healthy measure of our own limitations.
<BR>
<P>Human beings are imperfect and imperfectable, and
<BR>
their networks even more so. We should probably be happy
<BR>
for the noise and disruption in the channel, since so much
<BR>
of what we think we know, and love to teach, are mistakes
<BR>
and lies. But nevertheless, we can achieve progress
<BR>
here. We can remove some modicum of the fatal, choking
<BR>
constraints that throughout centuries have bent people
<BR>
double.
<BR>
<P>A human mind in pursuit of self-actualization should
<BR>
be allowed to go as far and as fast as our means allow.
<BR>
There is nothing utopian about this program; because
<BR>
there no timeless justice or perfect stability to be found
<BR>
in this vision. This practice will not lead us toward
<BR>
any dream, any City on a Hill, any phony form of static
<BR>
bliss. On the contrary, it will lead us into closer and
<BR>
closer, into more and more immediate contact, with the
<BR>
issues that really bedevil us.
<BR>
<P>Before many more decades pass, the human race will
<BR>
begin to obtain what it really wants. Then we will find
<BR>
ourselves confronted, in our bedrooms, streets, and
<BR>
breakfast tables, with real-world avatars of those
<BR>
Faustian visions of power and ability that have previously
<BR>
existed only in myth. Our aspirations will become
<BR>
consequences. That압 when our *real* trouble starts.
<BR>
<P>However, that is not a contemporary problem. The
<BR>
problems we face today are not those somber, long-term
<BR>
problems. On the contrary, we very clearly exist in a
<BR>
highly fortunate time with very minor problems.
<BR>
<P>The so-called human condition won앖 survive the
<BR>
next hundred years. That fate is written on the forehead
<BR>
of the 21st century in letters of fire. That fate can be
<BR>
wisely shaped, or somewhat postponed, or brutally
<BR>
annihilated, but it cannot be denied. It is coming
<BR>
because we want it. It압 not an alien imposition; it is
<BR>
borne from the inchoate depths of our own desires.
<BR>
But were not beyond the limits of humanity, suffering
<BR>
that, exulting in that. Were just going there, visibly
<BR>
moving closer to it. Once we get there, we앏l find no
<BR>
rest there. The appetite of divine discontent always
<BR>
grows by the feeding.
<BR>
<P>This dire knowledge makes today압 scene seem quite
<BR>
playful and delightful by faux-retrospect. Our worst
<BR>
problems, which may seem so large, diffuse, and morbid,
<BR>
are mere teenage angst compared to the conundrums were
<BR>
busily preparing for some other generation.
<BR>
<P>Sober assessment of the contemporary scene makes it
<BR>
crystal-clear that a carnival atmosphere is in order. We
<BR>
exist in a highly disposable civilization that is hell-
<BR>
bent on outmoding itself. The pace of change is melting
<BR>
former physical restraints into a maelstrom of
<BR>
reformattable virtualities. That압 here, it압 real,
<BR>
it is truly our situation. We should live as
<BR>
if we know this is true. This is where our own sincerity
<BR>
and authenticity are to be found: in the strong
<BR>
conviction that the contemporary is temporary.
<BR>
<P>We need to live in these conditions in good faith.
<BR>
We need to re-imagine life and make the new implications
<BR>
clear. It압 a murky situation, but we must not flinch
<BR>
from it; we must drench all of it in light. Because this
<BR>
is our home. We have no other. Our children live here.
<BR>
The mushroom clouds of the twentieth century have parted.
<BR>
We find ourselves on a beach, with wave after frothy
<BR>
wave of transformation. We have means, motive, and
<BR>
opportunity. Spread the light.
<BR>
<P>Henceforth, it will make more and more sense to
<BR>
base our deepest convictions around a hands-on
<BR>
confrontation with the consequences of technology.
<BR>
That압 where the action is. On January 3, 2000, that압
<BR>
what it압 about. The deepest resources of human
<BR>
creativity have a vital role there. It압 where
<BR>
inspiration is most needed, it압 the place to make a
<BR>
difference. Come out. Stand up. Shine.
<BR>
<P>Turn the lamps on all over the world.
