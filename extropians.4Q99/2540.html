*World's smallest transistor. Scientists have produced the world's smallest<br>
transistor. This new design may allow silicon chips to continue to get
smaller. It could also double the processing speeds of some chips. The
50-nanometer transistor - roughly 2,000 times smaller than the width of a
human hair - is known as a "vertical" transistor because all of its
components are built on top of a silicon wafer.

*Silver-based crystalline nanoparticles, microbially fabricated. "A strain<br>
of bacteria that can manufacture tiny crystals of silver has been reported
by Swedish scientists. This skill may eventually prove useful to engineers
who want to fabricate extremely small optical and electronic devices."

*Scientists Discover How to Make Nanostructures Assemble Themselves.<br>
Princeton researchers have created ultrasmall plastic structures with a
method that is cheaper and more versatile than previous techniques. The
discovery has yielded surprising insights into the behavior of materials at
very small scales, while spawning many basic research questions. It also
could pave the way to a new generation of miniature products, from computer
memory chips and video components to devices for sorting DNA molecules.

*Alphabet Originated Centuries Earlier Than Previously Thought. Sometime<br>
during the beginning of the second millennium B.C., long before ancient
biblical times, a traveler passing through a desert valley of what is now
southern Egypt, stopped at a rock and inscribed on it his name, his title
and probably a short prayer for safe passage. The discovery of this
traveler's ancient calling card, and another one similar to it, indicates
that the first alphabet.

Fujitsu, Hitachi, and so on -- that occupy all other spots on the Top500
website, the 44th-positioned machine is described as "self-made."

<br>
A team of chemists working at Arizona State University has designed and
synthesized the first stable example of an important new class of materials
that are expected to be of special use as catalysts. The new material, and
other materials that can now be created following its model, should be
useful in isolating and modifying molecules that previously known catalysts
have not been able to handle, particularly larger molecules.

*Curving Beyond Fermat. When Andrew Wiles of Princeton University proved<br>
Fermat’s last theorem several years ago, he took advantage of recently
discovered links between Pierre de Fermat’s centuries-old conjecture
concerning whole numbers and the theory of so-called elliptic curves.
Establishing the validity of Fermat’s last theorem involved proving parts of
the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture.Four mathematicians have now extended this
aspect of Wiles’ work, offering a proof of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture
for all elliptic curves rather than just a particular subset of them.
