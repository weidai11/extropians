	NEW JOURNAL - CALL FOR PAPERS


<p>
Title of the Journal :

<p>
        JOURNAL OF APPLIED SYSTEMS STUDIES
Methodologies and Applications for Systems Approaches
<p>
		[ JASS ]


<p>
AIMS AND SCOPE

<p>
The mission of the "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" is on the
development of methodologies based on the laws and rules of various
sciences. New designs and functional methodologies are composed for
applications in business, operational and social, as well as biological
phenomena. The objectives of the "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" are
to widespread the science of systems and present the research and
application results of its domain. As the science rapidly changes and
grows, resources and time become more precious, "Journal of Applied Systems
Studies" provides the very best information and analysis to keep up to date
with the latest developments and approaches to other scientific domains,
through the application of systems approaches upon them. 

<p>
The "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" aims to:
 To provide a forum for the exchange of experiences and information of
studying the systems and the methodologies, tools and products used to
design, measure and achieve it.
<br>
 To promote awareness of the crucial role of systems studies in the
effective construction of the information systems developed, used, and/or
maintained by organizations in pursuit of their business objectives.
 To provide a vehicle for the publication of academic papers related to
all aspects of soft and hard system approaches.

<p>
The "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" addresses all aspects of systemic
analysis from both a practical and an academic viewpoint. It invites
contributions from practitioners and academics, as well as national and
international policy, standard making bodies, and sets out to be the
definitive international reference source for such information.

<p>
The readership of the "Journal of Applied Systems Studies" consists of
academics, systems managers, computer scientists, information scientists,
and researchers in applied system theory, as well as those involved in
management, operations and political science in different scientific
discipline i.e. Universities, Consulting Firms, Enterprises and Industries.

applications. Systems papers must contain either a new methodology or
interpreted results through well known methodology(ies) on real systems or
simulations based on representative traces from real systems. Proposals for
special issues, especially on emerging topics, are also welcome.

GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTORS

<p>
Authors should send to the Editor-in-Chief via email (assinik@unipi.gr) the
paper in attached file(s) using "winzip32" for compression, with a
description in the body of the message, and by post a printed copy along
with the electronic file(s) submission on a 3 diskette which should
conform the following requirements :
<br>
1.	Manuscripts must be submitted in English and spelling should be adapted
with The Concise Oxford Dictionary. Original papers (not published or not
simultaneously submitted to another journal) will be reviewed by three
anonymous referees. Upon acceptance of an article by the journal, the
author(s) will be asked to transfer copyright of the article to the
publisher which it will insure the widest possible dissemination of
information under applicable copyright law. 
2.	The disk should be in IBM PC format; the files should be saved in
Microsoft Word for PC, version 97 for Windows. Any other word-processing
package will not be approved for submission. For artwork, figures and
tables should only use the Ms-Office 97 package facilities and must be
grouped and pasted, in the proper place, into the Word document. 
3.	Papers should be typed on one side of the paper. The pages should be
numbered consecutively at the bottom centre of the page. The length of the
paper should not exceed 10 journal pages (or about 5000 words), and hence
manuscripts should not exceed 15 typed single-space A4 (printing area 14.7
x 24.7 cm) pages including title page, abstract, text, figures, tables and
references. The number of artworks, figures and tables must be kept up to a
minimum. Do not start a new page after the title information and abstract.
Do not use tab for the first text line of each main section. Paragraphs
should be both right and left justified.
4.	The fonts (typeface) is Times New Roman. The text type size should be 11
points. Please use the page set-up command to ensure that your paper is
prepared on A4 size paper (21 x 29.7 cm) using the default format for text
and margins at the top and the bottom of the page for Microsoft Word 97.
5.	The title should be written on the first line of the first page, left
justified in upper and lower case letters (20-points bold). The authors'
names should be left justified two lines below the full title in upper and
lower case letters (14-points). Affiliation and mailing address (including
email) should follow left justified also in upper and lower case letters
<br>
(11-points). <br>
<br>
6.	Two lines below the author's name and affiliation start an abstract as
the first paragraph of the paper. The abstract should follow the title,
author's name, and mailing address on the first page (10-points) and must
be up to 150 words. At the end of the abstract, skip a line and then, left
justified, type "Keywords" (10-points bold) : followed by up to three (3)
sets of words that describe the focus and contribution of the paper
<br>
(10-points). The first set of keyword must be one of the topics of interest<br>
to JASS. Skip two lines and then begin the body of the paper (after an
Introduction heading if required) immediately after the abstract.
7.	All major headings are left justified. They are to be written in
12-points bold font and numbered consecutively followed by a period and the
default tab, with Arabic numerals, e.g., 1.	Introduction. Do not put a
period after the text of the heading. Leave two lines above a major heading
and one line before the start of the next paragraph or second-level
heading. Subheadings are flush left in 11-points bold. There should be one
line space before and after this level of heading. The paragraph should be
numbered as a subsection of the previous major heading and the default tab
e.g., 7.1	Subheadings. Sub-subheadings are flush left, in italics and in
11-points type. The paragraphs should be numbered as a sub-section of the
previous subsection heading and the default tab e.g., 7.1.1
Sub-subheadings. There should be one line space before this level of
heading and after this level of heading and the following paragraph.
8.	The electronic version of the art should be included in the attached
files and on the diskette, and it must be incoprorated into the
word-processing file. Figures should be labeled in the text as "Figure x".
Figure captions should be typed directly below the figure, in upper and
lower case (11-points), and centred.
<br>
9.	Table captions should be centered above the table. Tables should be
included in the manuscript proper and referred to in the text as "Table x".
10.	When numbering equations, enclose numbers in parenthesis ( ) and place
them flush with the right-hand margin. Refer to them in the text as
"Equation (x)".
<pre>
11.	Papers should be written without the use of footnotes.
12.	Mathematical expressions and Greek or other symbols should be typed
</pre>
using the facilities of Ms-Word 97 and must be written clearly with ample
spacing. Use the widely accepted symbols and abbreviations following the
style of BS 1991 Part 2 1954.
<br>
13.	All papers should end with a conclusion which summarizes the value of
the work end, where appropriate, indicates possible directions for future
developments.
<br>
14.	References must be indicated in the text by brackets [ ]. Identify
references in the text of the paper by typing the corresponding surname (or
first surname) and year in brackets e.g.: [Aauthor (1998)]. They are listed
alphabetically at the end of the paper under the major heading "References"
<br>
(12-point bold font) left justified. List authors alphabetically by the<br>
first letter of the first author's surname name. Book titles and names of
journals should be printed in italics. Please adopt the following style for
references :

<pre>
