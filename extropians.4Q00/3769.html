<p>Damien Broderick
<br>
<p>=========================
<br>
<p>Structuralist literary theory elaborated various binary models of the way
<br>
in which fictional sentences and larger structures are generated and
<br>
received. Despite the problems that we've discussed with binary
<br>
oppositions, one of these distinctions remains a fruitful site for
<br>
investigation. On Roman Jakobson's classical Prague-semiotics analysis,
<br>
language (and, by extension, all coded signifying systems) operates between
<br>
two poles, metaphor and metonymy. Each is a principle of verbal
<br>
substitution, the first by actual or fancied resemblance (crown standing
<br>
for dental prosthesis, because it `caps' the tooth), the second by
<br>
part-for-whole, or whole-for-part, based on contiguity or connection (the
<br>
crown standing for the king, because only a monarch may wear one). In his
<br>
description of the construction of message strings, Jakobson ([1956], 1971)
<br>
suggestively conflated metaphor with selection (where a signifier is
<br>
selected from a list or lexical `paradigm' of alternatives) and metonymy
<br>
with combination (where one word or concept bonds with another that is in
<br>
some respect adjacent in meaning-space - for example, a fragment standing
<br>
in for the whole). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first instance, then, both metaphor and metonymy (or synecdoche)
<br>
are figures of speech, ways of replacing one term by another. Drawing on
<br>
the Hesse net or the collective-computation models described above, we
<br>
might say that two such concepts are linked by lines of association which
<br>
bear differing probability weights, or brought together in a shared
<br>
multi-dimensional `basin of attraction'. If one enters a search at any
<br>
given point in the network, some words will be retrieved by their
<br>
structural resemblance (as previously constructed and indexed by the net),
<br>
some by partial association, some by explicit negation of resemblance (and
<br>
these, it should be noted, will be strongly linked, rather than, say, being
<br>
stored separately with very low probability of association: not-A being
<br>
salient in a different way from non-A).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is plausible, we see that the Hesse net location of `hat' will
<br>
forge synaptic connections with the neurons storing various other terms:
<br>
some linking by structural resemblance at the conceptual level (`bowl',
<br>
`scarf') or the phonic/lexical level (`cat', `drat'), others by
<br>
associations of use or familiarity (`head', `wife' - permitting Oliver
<br>
Sacks's patient to mistake his wife for his hat), or connections of part
<br>
and whole (`brim', `garment trade', `label'), and so on.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within these parameters, a metaphor is a word-choice which evokes another
<br>
word by a fancied underlying structural equivalence in the signifieds or
<br>
concepts they tag, while a metonymy replaces one word with another by
<br>
virtue of some adjacency or continuity in the signifieds.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a somewhat strained visual pun on Cartesian co-ordinates, Jakobson
<br>
created a further metaphor of his own, linking all acts of lexical
<br>
selection with a `metaphoric axis' and of sentence construction or
<br>
combination with a `metonymic axis'. The Cartesian model is apparent: a
<br>
vertical y axis, traditionally the parameter for mapping location in time,
<br>
is identified with the paradigmatic list of roughly equivalent words, while
<br>
a horizontal x axis, traditionally the parameter for graphing motion in
<br>
space, shows the syntagmatic or step-by-step activity of linking the words
<br>
chosen from the paradigmatic lexicon. The ascription is perhaps arbitrary;
<br>
a case can be made for reversing these tags, so that the time axis notates
<br>
the step-by-step chaining of syntagmata, while the space axis registers the
<br>
sites where items comprising each separate paradigm are stored, heaped
<br>
together for instant access.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some further confusion is also evident. The activity of selecting words
<br>
from paradigmatic lists of synonyms is hardly restricted to metaphoric
<br>
substitutions but, of course, will also entail metonymic discriminations.
<br>
And while words which are combined syntagmatically in sentences thereby
<br>
acquire a measure of mutual metonymic shading, this obtains only as a
<br>
second-order effect (though a crucially important one).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machines of the Unconscious
<br>
<p>Under the influence of the psychoanalytic revival, a further pair of
<br>
distinctions has also been conflated into these axes: Freud's mechanisms of
<br>
condensation and displacement. The first is ventured to account for the
<br>
collapse into a single word or image (in dreams and unintentional
<br>
word-plays) of components otherwise not obviously linked. We might construe
<br>
this as the creation - or revelation - of a new paradigm containing these
<br>
several elements. The second transfers to an apparently innocuous word or
<br>
image the charged emotions properly associated with another. This is
<br>
arguably a syntagmatic procedure (Silverman, 1983, pp. 87-125). In brief:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[S]election and combination impart structure and meaning to messages
<br>
whether the repertoire of the code consists of discontinuous forms, like
<br>
DNA, or of continuous forms....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the axis of the code selection corresponds to substitution and
<br>
similarity, the axis of metaphor.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the axis of the message combination corresponds to contexture and
<br>
contiguity, the axis of metonymy. (Wilden, 1987b, pp. 197-8)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Citing Jakobson's analysis of the plight of aphasic patients, Wilden notes
<br>
that in `similarity defects' the procedures for combining words and
<br>
understanding their context remain effective, although synonymy is impaired
<br>
(he terms this `coding disorder'). In `contiguity defects', the reverse
<br>
occurs: patients retain access to lists of words but cannot combine them
<br>
for effective communication (a loss which Wilden terms `message disorder')
<br>
(p. 199).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this basis, Wilden lays out a typical synoptic schema for this model: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The axis of the code links the following functions or terms of
<br>
discrimination:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selection and substitution, similarity, langue, simultaneity and
<br>
synchrony, paradigm, metaphor, condensation, harmony.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. The axis of the message links these alternative functions or terms of
<br>
discrimination:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combination and contexture, contiguity, parole, succession and diachrony,
<br>
syntagm, metonymy, displacement, melody (p. 202).
<br>
<p>The worth of these distinctions depends to some degree on the faith one has
<br>
in the models that precede their elaboration: for instance, Freud's
<br>
postulation of primary and secondary processes. (Silverman maintains that
<br>
`condensation and displacement represent the habitual response of the
<br>
primary process to similarity and contiguity, while paradigm and syntagm
<br>
constitute the normal response of the secondary process. Metaphor and
<br>
metonymy will be seen as occupying a mediate position....' (Silverman,
<br>
1983, p. 86). While for the purposes of my argument, I find the distinction
<br>
between the two classes to be of strategic value, it is worth exploring
<br>
some alternative ways to capture it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal segregation is between operators of equivalence and
<br>
sequence, akin to space and time. Some alternative pairs (none of them
<br>
binary oppositions) are: list (or file), versus path (or track) (a
<br>
distinction recalling the two conjectured methods whereby, in Kosslyn's
<br>
mental imagery experiment, subjects `move' from place to place in an
<br>
imaginary landscape); map and route; frames and schemata; matrix and vector
<br>
(which might suggest an analogy with the quantum description of eigenvalues
<br>
on a state vector); position and momentum; and so perhaps, in the deepest
<br>
layers of the phallocratic imagination, uterus and penis (a typical example
<br>
of masculine appropriative - and imaginary - hierarchies). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of these pairs is synonymous with any other, yet taken together they
<br>
suggest a strategic map on which theory might plot its tactical routes, a
<br>
list of cognitive locations from which one might choose to draw a suitable
<br>
path. Perhaps significantly, it is only now that the syntagmatic end of the
<br>
dichotomy is being granted equal analytical importance. In Beyond
<br>
Superstructuralism, for example, Richard Harland has opened an intriguing
<br>
path winding through a variety of intellectual territories, bringing them
<br>
into fruitful communication. Because his ambit is so impressively large, it
<br>
is impossible to give a fair account of his achievement - which, in turn,
<br>
is really only a ground-clearing exercise. `Most of the hard work,' he
<br>
admits candidly at the end, `remains to be done' (p. 225).
<br>
Superstructuralism, you'll recall, is a whimsical-but-serious term Harland
<br>
coined to capture the common biases and techniques of traditional
<br>
structuralism - most famously, the Lévi-Straussian variety that unmasked
<br>
binary oppositions inside myths and other cultural discourses - as well as
<br>
Theory's post-structuralisms which unpicked those oppositions in turn,
<br>
claiming that apparent polarities always enfold each other in a ceaseless
<br>
shimmer of uncertainty. Invoking a syntagmatic theory, Harland steps beyond
<br>
that story by emphasising the similarity dimension that has tended to be
<br>
overlooked in a metaphor-obsessed modernist tradition. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theory, by and large, ruthlessly deconstructs single words, building their
<br>
several denotations into ornate narratives. Derrida's
<br>
philosophical-cum-literary career has produced a series of these fertile
<br>
vortices of ambiguity: différance, pharmakon, supplément. Like the
<br>
components of Mallarmé's symbolist poems, these words `disseminate' into an
<br>
infinite haze of reverberations. While acknowledging the merits of this
<br>
approach, Harland insists that we return our gaze to a forgotten component
<br>
in the chain: the chain itself, the sentence-string along which these words
<br>
are strung like flashing jewels: the syntagm. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shift to a syntagmatic analysis is strikingly consequential. Meaning,
<br>
as Harland reminds us, is never found in individual words, but `stretches
<br>
across' them on a higher semantic level. An unsettling implication is that
<br>
words in a syntagm (a sentence, or chunked part of a sentence) do not add
<br>
or multiply together to create a meaningful message. Rather, each extra
<br>
word acts to subtract or narrow or refine the multitudinous connotations
<br>
that a lexicon would credit to each of the words. Far from rejoicing in the
<br>
unchecked dissemination of allusions, which Theory applauds and performs
<br>
(often with witless ingenuity), syntagmatic processes act like a series of
<br>
overlapping coloured filters, progressively cutting out one hue after
<br>
another from the spectrum, leaving at the end a crisp(ish) set of
<br>
restricted tints (or meanings) (p. 17).
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put like that, it might not seem such a startling thought. In the torrent
<br>
of turn-of-millennium thought, however, it is distinctly contrary.
<br>
Harland's impressive achievement has been to explore its implications in
<br>
fields tracking from philosophy (where it reinstates a form of
<br>
phenomenology, dispelling errors in both metaphysics and analytical
<br>
empiricism), to semantics and syntax, to literary readings, textual
<br>
interpretation and the woes of deconstruction. It is too soon, however, to
<br>
know if his unorthodox suggestion will prove acceptable to the rival
<br>
theoreticians of various superstructural schools. 
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modernism, Postmodernism, Antimodernism
<br>
<p>Metaphor and metonymy, or paradigm and syntagm, are resonant figures, then,
<br>
for more than figuration itself. Novelist and theorist David Lodge (1981,
<br>
pp. 3-16) discerns a regular pendulum swing in critical and creative
<br>
literary taste between two poles: the `transparent' or `realist', and the
<br>
`obscure', `symbolist' and inward. Since the second is `modernist', the
<br>
first, contemporary with it but never on exactly the same footing (being
<br>
sometimes higher in estimate, sometimes lower), Lodge dubs `antimodernist'.
<br>
The arrival of the `postmodernist' (which Christine Brooke-Rose [1981, p.
<br>
345], a cautious admirer of Lodge's typologies, has naughtily suggested
<br>
means `most-modernist')
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continues the modernist critique of traditional realism, but it tries to
<br>
go beyond or around or underneath modernism, which for all its formal
<br>
experiment and complexity held out to the reader the promise of meaning, if
<br>
not of a meaning. (Lodge, 1981, p. 12)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What powers this pendulum? Lodge suggests that it is the resurgent
<br>
consumer (and producer) need for novelty, defamiliarisation, coupled with
<br>
the bipolar nature of the linguistic function itself. According to Lodge's
<br>
rather-too-neat story, modernism is a technique of writing and reading (and
<br>
reality-construction) founded preferentially in metaphor. Antimodernist
<br>
`realism' is given, by contrast, to figuration based on synecdoche or
<br>
metonymy. The postmodernists, predictably, push both poles to an extreme;
<br>
they `tested them, as it were, to destruction, parodied and burlesqued them
<br>
in the process of using them, and thus sought to escape from their tyranny'
<br>
(Lodge, 1981, p. 14). Arguably their escape, by definition, must be into
<br>
silence or inanity. To take a more hopeful view, escape from the
<br>
metaphor/metonymy metronome might lead into a rupture with `verities' so
<br>
deeply instilled that no-one functioning in a given episteme can readily
<br>
appreciate their arbitrariness. That escape route is commonly taken to be
<br>
post-structuralist Theory.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Uses of Pragmatics
<br>
<p>In the light of such investigations into categorisation and the discursive
<br>
construction of textuality (if not of reality entire), it must be asked
<br>
whether the apparently divergent impulses of referential, ideological and
<br>
deconstructive analyses can be brought to a common focus or shared account.
<br>
A persuasive synthesis of the most telling features of these disjoint
<br>
approaches has been sketched by Christopher Butler (1984). Like many of the
<br>
more interesting post-deconstructive discussions of how we read, his
<br>
synopsis is regulated by pragmatism:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For if the text has multiple implications... and if the interpreter can
<br>
also choose amongst structuralist, deconstructionist, Marxist, and liberal
<br>
moralist frameworks... then the apparent anarchy of pluralism can at least
<br>
be brought into some order, and lose its air of indifferentism, if we ask
<br>
that... interpreters should be as clear as possible about the ends for
<br>
which they interpret. (ibid., x)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Tellingly, use becomes the final arbiter. Yet `use' has application only
<br>
within a pre-established context of situation and ends. Language may be
<br>
made to turn on itself in search of fissures and aporias, but such
<br>
sceptical deconstructive play is inevitably grounded in the fact that
<br>
language is a social and socialising tool through which, in large part, we
<br>
humans are constituted as persons (`subjects'), and with which we
<br>
coordinate our physical and mental activities in the supraindividual
<br>
functions of our collectivity. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those joint activities in turn may be construed as `texts', but it is
<br>
arguable that such texts are written in a metalanguage of higher logical
<br>
type not amenable to disruption from levels subordinate to their own. (For
<br>
instance, the apparent paradox generated by a sign which states `Disregard
<br>
This Sign' vanishes when we see that the shifter particle `this' cannot
<br>
meaningfully be applied self-reflexively; it must gesture to a referent of
<br>
lower logical type. It makes perfect sense to write `Disregard this sign on
<br>
Sundays' if the words are followed by an injunction applying to all other
<br>
days, but that is because we see that `this' then refers to the injunction
<br>
thus denoted, not to the sign in toto. With the disappearance of the
<br>
oppressive sense of paradox, we can register the sign as a witty or parodic
<br>
demolition of authoritarian injunction). If so, the best that can be done
<br>
is to make pragmatic choices, the terms of which are declared within
<br>
superordinate systems.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butler's case begins with a preliminary stipulation, later challenged, of
<br>
`common-sense' linguistic referentiality. How do we understand? `[T]he
<br>
meaning of sentences, and above them of discourse and texts, has to be
<br>
interpreted in context, as relevant to a situation, which thereby activates
<br>
a complex of beliefs in the speaker and hearer or author and reader'
<br>
(Butler, 1984, p. 1). This complex of enabling beliefs includes logical
<br>
implicature, such that all and only those canonical implications of a given
<br>
sentence can be assumed as infolded within the sentence. Familiarity, so to
<br>
speak, breeds context, and context familiarity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to see, although Butler does not make the point, that this
<br>
account faces several recurrent philosophical difficulties. To utter a
<br>
sentence which describes the appearance of a golden mountain or a unicorn
<br>
is to seem to insist on the same ontological status for the referents of
<br>
their signifieds as would be appropriate to observables such as ordinary
<br>
mountains or horses - an error which considerable 20th century analysis has
<br>
worked hard to elucidate and expel. In short, the fact that language
<br>
invokes logical implicature tends to set boundary conditions rather than
<br>
reveal novelties. (Perhaps this is explained by Wilden's model in which
<br>
sensory experience takes analog forms which parse by `more-or-less' while
<br>
communication takes discontinuous digitalised forms, analytic logic being
<br>
nothing if not digital.)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the strict constraints of logic we encounter pragmatic `contextual
<br>
determinants of implicit meaning' (Butler, 1984, p. 1). No intelligible
<br>
text-fragment is an island. Each is uttered in a language whose grammar and
<br>
lexicon are shared by other speaker/writer/readers, for even the severest
<br>
idiolect is a transformed version of a common tongue:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus our model for interpretation must include not only a body of
<br>
linguistic knowledge (a grammar), but also a background of knowledge and
<br>
belief (an `encyclopaedia' for short) which can if necessary be made
<br>
explicit in interpretation. (p. 2)
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The informational voids and gaps in any textual syntagmatic string are
<br>
enormous by comparison with the richness of information we construe (not
<br>
exactly the same as `construct') from the material provided. The coding
<br>
involved is always a sort of metonymic condensation. Consider a homely
<br>
example: the word `dog' is hugely overdetermined for both addresser and
<br>
addressee, and in quite different ways for each. Possibly it includes every
<br>
dog each has ever encountered in life, in pictorial illustration, in
<br>
fiction. Each bears its freight of affect and further conceptual
<br>
associations, adding to a vast ramifying synaptic and semiotic root-system
<br>
(or computational-energy `landscape'). These arrays, stored in individual
<br>
heads, just sufficiently resemble those in other heads that generally a
<br>
salient response can be evoked, it is hoped, without a great deal of
<br>
backing and filling. Plainly, though, the word `dog' alone cannot provoke a
<br>
particularly sharp determinate response or `concretisation'. In a fiction
<br>
text, much of the mood and set shaped by preliminary and subsequent codings
<br>
help govern the way a reader actualises this schematic element. But each of
<br>
those in turn also depends, like the struts of a geodesic dome, on the
<br>
tensility of its neighbours. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Categories and Prototypes
<br>
<p>Eleanor Rosch's important researches into categorisation bear on this
<br>
issue. Gardner summarises her findings thus:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Categories are built around a central member or prototype - a
<br>
representative example of that class which shares the most features with
<br>
other members of the category while sharing few, in any, features with
<br>
elements drawn from outside the class. (Howard Gardner, 1985, p. 346)
<br>
<p>Rosch discerns several moments in this process. There is a basic level that
<br>
is defined by the ease with which children and newcomers acquire its grasp:
<br>
`dog' is a primitive on this level. Above this is a superordinate level,
<br>
such as `animal', `mammal', `pet', `food' (or `inedible'), or perhaps
<br>
`totem'. Thus, as Barry Barnes has shown in his remarks on Hesse nets, a
<br>
cassowary may be assimilated to the prototype of a totemic group which has
<br>
no other avian members, while a bat may be drawn into the group of `winged
<br>
animals' that we would not parse as `birds'. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the basic level is a subordinate level that more closely specifies
<br>
the individual case, such as `German Pointer', `Pointer-Heeler Cross',
<br>
`Imme', `Rommy' or `Meggy', and so on. However, as we have noted
<br>
repeatedly, `categories in the real world tend to have fuzzy boundaries and
<br>
to blend into one another' (ibid.). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all that, these categories are not, as a Whorfian or Saussurean would
<br>
demand, entirely a matter of free convention. Rosch's work on colour
<br>
discrimination has demonstrated that with visual perception `what looks
<br>
similar [both within a culture, and between cultures] is not in the least
<br>
arbitrary. For example, our visual system is so designed as to treat
<br>
certain reds as better than others, and to draw the line between red and
<br>
orange [etc] at specific points on what looks (to the instruments of the
<br>
physical scientist) like a continuous spectrum' (p. 347). In other words,
<br>
the human perceptual system is hard-wired to transduce certain of Wilden's
<br>
smoothly varying analog information sources into crisply separate digital
<br>
discriminations, or to try its damnedest to do so. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, the task of interpreting a piece of fiction clearly shares
<br>
certain characteristics with the task of interpreting any other organised
<br>
sensory input. The internal organisation of a text constrains each act of
<br>
parsing we perform, rendering some later `actualisations' more probable
<br>
than others, yet also able to 
<br>
&nbsp;force a re-assessment of what we have already settled as our provisional
<br>
reading. Butler turns to the social linguist Michael Halliday for his
<br>
notion of an intratextual `co-text':
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the text is typically `internally cohesive, and it functions as a
<br>
whole as the relevant environment for the operation of the theme and
<br>
informational systems'.... I shall... attempt to distinguish between
<br>
co-text in this sense and `context', by which I shall mean the situation of
<br>
the text in the world. This will include such matters as the text's
<br>
referring `beyond itself' to `external reality'. (Butler, 1984, p. 2)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How, then, do we read a set of consecutive sentences? If they are
<br>
presented to us as a single text, we bring to bear (even if we are
<br>
card-carrying postmodernists) the preliminary assumption that they tell a
<br>
unified story - that in some sense they `hang together', whatever exotic or
<br>
polysemy-besotted sense of `unified' we might be employing. In Rumelhart's
<br>
terms, `schemata are activated, evaluated, refined or discarded'; Butler
<br>
adds: `various reader's interpretations of [such schemata's] relevance to
<br>
one another are remarkably consistent' (p. 5, citing D. Rumelhart, 1979).
<br>
His elaborated model draws on Van Dijk, de Beaugrande, Eco and others, and
<br>
distinguishes between `frame', which contains the knowledge of the
<br>
background elements that we bring to a text, and `schema', the ordered use
<br>
of these elements.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similar postulates, as I've noted previously, have been forced upon
<br>
analysts working in artificial intelligence research, who have found that
<br>
computerised simulation systems require `common sense' before they can
<br>
perceive and act with any vestige of intelligence. One favoured method of
<br>
simulating common sense is the insertion of `scripts' - `the canonical set
<br>
of events one can expect in an often encountered setting' - which are
<br>
precisely frames of reference and `tacit knowledge' necessary to organise
<br>
`experience' into parsable chunks calling for determinable responses. What
<br>
is more, the necessity for such semantic exfoliations from each central
<br>
lexical node has been one of the principal objections raised to Chomsky's
<br>
early syntactic linguistics, and the motive for his current virtual
<br>
abolition in transformational grammar of a metastasising number of deep
<br>
structure moves in favour of semantically-loaded generative lexical
<br>
elements governed by pragmatic constraints.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underlying this model is a neurosemantic hypothesis: that within our
<br>
brains we map the world in chunks and micro-scripts, which are
<br>
transformable through conventional coding into public texts, these in turn
<br>
receivable by brains similarly supplied with cognitive maps not too grossly
<br>
at variance with those which encoded the texts. [etc etc]
