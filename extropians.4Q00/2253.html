** The question:
<br>
<p>Suppose Person A wants to open up a bar, and applies for a liquor license. 
<br>
Persons B, consisting of the resident/owners of a nearby condominium complex,
<br>
are annoyed by this for the standard reasons - increased noise, increased
<br>
traffic, violent drunks wandering around, and decreased property values. 
<br>
Suppose that Persons B sign a petition to deny a liquor license to Person A,
<br>
thus annoying Person A and any investors thereof.  Do you agree or disagree
<br>
with the following statements?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(A) Signing a petition to deny a liquor license is an improper use of
<br>
government mechanisms, constituting the initiation of force.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(B) Signing the petition may be a minor initiation of force, but that's a
<br>
justified response to the bar's proposed initiation of noise (or the other
<br>
negative effects).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest available
<br>
approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms that would exist in a
<br>
libertarian society - for example, distributed ownership of &quot;noise rights&quot;.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(D) This is a straightforward conflict of interest between the bar builders
<br>
and the condo owners, and invoking libertarian ethics is needlessly
<br>
complicating the issue.

<br>
<p><p>** Notes on phrasing
<br>
<p>Several voters expressed surprise at the phrasing of D, stating that they
<br>
agreed with the first half of the statement but not the second - that
<br>
Libertarian ethics are precisely relevant to what methods are permissible in
<br>
solving conflicts of interest.  I entirely agree.  The phrasing of D expresses
<br>
a viewpoint which I disagree with - i.e., that the methods discussed above
<br>
(bar building, petitions) are as morally neutral as two sellers trying to
<br>
undercut the other's price.  Please note that four people still voted for D as
<br>
phrased, which indicates that this is, indeed, a viewpoint held by some
<br>
voters.
<br>
<p>Dan Fabulich suggested the following rephrasing for &quot;B&quot;, which, in retrospect,
<br>
would have been much better:  &quot;The citizens who signed the petition are not
<br>
initiating force; the bar initiated force by initiating noise and other
<br>
negative effects, and the citizens are forcefully retaliating.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>** Quotes from the votes
<br>
<p>Dave Sill:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [ A: agree B: disagree C: don't know D: disagree ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the two sides should meet to raise the issues and options. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proponent might not want to locate in an area where he's not welcome. Or he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be willing to compensate the opponents. Or they might be willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensate him to locate elsewhere.
</em><br>
<p>Michael S. Lorrey:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the land is zoned for commercial use, and the condos were built and occupied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully aware that the neighboring land was zoned for commercial use, then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have absolutely no argument whatsoever. If the prospective bar owners are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change the zoning or get a variance or other exception, then that is another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; story, and the neighboring residents have a right to contribute their opinions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the zoning/permitting process, but their opinions cannot be binding on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision of zoning and alcohol board members. Moreover, if the prospective bar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owners can do a noise study of the existing property, and of another facility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere that is similar to what they have planned, and show no significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to the existing noise pollution, then neighbors opinions don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; count for much. Also, if there were any similar businesses in the property in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past (no matter how long ago), then that use is grandfathered.
</em><br>
<p>James Wetterau:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with A -- and on those grounds I wouldn't sign such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; petition.  For similar reasons, when I lived in Manhattan and some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; residents of my neighborhood tried to &quot;preserve the character&quot; of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighborhood by petitioning the city to prevent the building of new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high-rise apartment buildings, I opposed the petition to some of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbors and refused to sign.  I was also annoyed by the city's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempts to harass and remove strip clubs, though I did not myself go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them, which were successful.  Naturally I disagree with B.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I somewhat disagree with C, though I recognize that the city could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function that way.  My concern is that though the city *could be* the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nearest approximation of a dispute resolution mechanism, it's far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to blindly support the majority against the minority, even if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority is made up of some people who would be barely affected,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not at all affected, and the minority has a vital interest, due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mechanisms of voting.  Thus the city may act very perversely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignore the interests of whoever is in the minority in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrative region, whereas in a fair system it might well be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that most people in the region should have no input.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with precisely half of D: &quot;this is a straightforward conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of interest ... &quot; but not with this half: &quot;invoking libertarian ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is needlessly complicating the issue&quot;.  It's interesting from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian perspective to see how our society deals with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforward conflicts of interest.  I think that, in general, US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society does better with such conflicts than with the true government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrors (war on drugs), but still there's room for improvement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All the best,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James Wetterau
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S. If I were to imagine a libertarian response, it would go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something like this -- don't oppose the bar, but while it's going in,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meet with the bar owner.  Try to discuss concerns in advance.  How is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bar owner going to make sure that people are secure passing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bar?  Will the bar owner try to make the bar the kind of place people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the neighboring condo would enjoy going?  Will the bar owner take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effort to get drunks into cabs home swiftly?  Will noise be abated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by good heavy doors and walls, and a ventilation system that permits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; windows to be kept closed?  Perhaps the bar owner will be a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbor by allowing community groups to use rooms, bathrooms, phones,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc., or by hiring people from the neighborhood?  In return the condo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owner could explain what it's like to deal with city government, what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing business in the community is like, etc..  If done right, the bar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could actually improve the value of the property, rather than lowering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  Bars don't have to be hives of violent, miserable people.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can provide valuable places for public gathering and performance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If in fact the bar turns out to be a nuisance, the bar owner could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then try to either deal directly with the bar owner in a friendly way,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or by calling the police to enforce noise and nuisance ordinances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already on the books almost everywhere.  
</em><br>
<p>stencil:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why - in a Libertarian society - would the condo residents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be permitted to stigmatize &quot;a bar?&quot;  First-class
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restaurants sell alcohol too;  and many other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishments have the potential to attract undesireable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clientele - theaters, concert halls, schools, nursing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homes... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the extent that humanity has gotten where it is through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ad-hoc approach to the universe, as opposed to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmatic one, isn't it inhumane to license - that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrict - activities that are not *intrinsically* evil?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So you'd pick option A, right?  That's what it sounds like; I just want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Naah, still D;  what I'm objecting to is the licensing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process that the petition would seek to influence, not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the petition itself.  As he said just before she slapped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him, it doesn't hurt to ask, does it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you say, But we must have some control over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; establishment of nuisances, then I say, since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuisances are all in the subjunctive, then make your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controls equivalently conditional.  If you fixate on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weeds you'll end up paving over your garden.  Ordnung muss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ja sein, but not in my back yard.
</em><br>
<p>Robin Hanson:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd say C, it's close to what anarchy would do.
</em><br>
<p>Michael Bast:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd have to say (c), since it is a dispute, and someone has to resolve it, short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of violence. The petition may be an initiation of force, if there's an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectation of it getting you what you want when you have no legitimate right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved, or it might simply be a way of getting the government to pay attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this violation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Ethics (specifically libertarian here, but ethics in general) ARE the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue, that is how to determine who's right, by what values and methods is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answered arrived at, and are all parties satisfied about the justice of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Given that both parties think they have a legitimate interest in what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want, and they can't both have all of what they want, it seems fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; straightforward. Unless you want to add complicating issues, as are inevitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in life...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (C) The city government deciding the issue is the nearest available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation to the dispute resolution mechanisms that would exist in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian society - for example, distributed ownership of &quot;noise rights&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>William Sullivan:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not clear on the above two options. My understanding of the libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position (if I can be excused for discussing the vast, conflicting body of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarian opinion as one position for a moment) was not that there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts of interest and therefore initiation of force is improper, but that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiation of force is improper and especially so when interests conflict. So,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would seem to me that the second half of option (D) (after the second 'and')
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a bit weird; if one agrees with the first half of the option's description of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem, then &quot;libertarian ethics&quot; help to simplify the issue, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicate it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As it so happens, this last is my position. I agree with the first half of (D)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (before the second 'and') and the entirety of (A) (with the possible exception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the last five words, which I could quite happily live without). And I think I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would also hold this position from the perspective of the bar owner, the condo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; owner, and a third-party; the issue of precedence  and legitimacy is of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utmost importance and regardless of the benefit the condo owner may gain from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the closing of the bar, empowering and/or encouraging a government like this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous.
</em><br>
<p>Sean Kenny:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say C as long as the wealthier party (the bar owner or the local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; residents) is not a position to exert undue pressure, which unfortunately is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually the case. But then I'm a liberal, not a libertarian. :)
</em><br>
<p>Damien Broderick:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 0.6 B, 0.4 C (off the fuzzy top of my head)
</em><br>
<p>Dan Fabulich:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Undefined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If this were a libertarian anarcho-capitalist society, then noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights would be settled ahead of time in some formal way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps they have, and the bar approves of a government like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose, the rule of law is that you control your noise rights, unless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone throws together a petition to stop you, in which case, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lose them.  In this case, clearly, the bar does not entirely own its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise rights.  If we assume that the bar approves of a government like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, or if the government in question is a Nozickian &quot;government&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consisting only of the set of PPAs and arbitratian agencies operating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the area, (in which case, the bar has revealed preference for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;government,&quot;) then the answer is C.  The bar, if it so wishes, may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buy its noise rights from the citizenry at some fair price.  If it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuses to pay this, then it's not best for the bar to operate here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway, since it's not willing to pay its own costs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the rule of law is that the bar owns its own noise rights, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens approve of or reveal approval of the government, then, if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; petition has no effect, no force, no foul.  In that case, the answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is C again, but in this case, the government refuses to do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the petition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the bar does NOT exhibit revealed approval of the government in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question, and if noise is not force, or if noise rights are up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; air, then this could be a case of A.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You've gotten no agreements to B so far because you phrased it wrongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as far as libertarians are concerned.  The better way to phrase B
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (B') &quot;The citizens who signed the petition are not initiating force;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bar initiated force by initiating noise and other negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects, and the citizens are forcefully retaliating.&quot;  If noise is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force, and the citizens have not approved of or given revealed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preference for the government, then the answer is B'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disapproval = non-agreement and not revealing preferences in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nozickian &quot;government&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Noise = noise and all the other negative effects of a bar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bar disapproves of government and noise is not force: A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Citizens disapprove of government and noise is force: B'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otherwise: C.
</em><br>
<p>Brian D Williams:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;C&quot; is the clear choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is in fact common practice, Park Ridge Il, also known locally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as &quot;Pleasantville&quot; ( Where Hillary Clinton is from) is a &quot;dry&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community, only restaurants may serve alcohol.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some local entrepreneurs opened a &quot;Hooters&quot; just accross the street
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the boundary and the town tried to deny them a liquor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Hooters held out and the matter was finally decided by a judge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hooters won.
</em><br>
<p>Fraser Orr:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My vote is sort of C or D, depending on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you interepret their meanings. Specifically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is a simple pollution problem. Without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a doubt a certain amount of pollution from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one property to another is necessary. If I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play my CD player quietly, the sound will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; travel into my neighbor's home, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bellow the level of human sensory detection,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however, it will be there. If I light a match
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in my backyard, photons from the fire will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undoubtedly reach my neighbor's backyard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, probably not enough to be bothersome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently, many actions produce some form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pollution, whether noise, photonic, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical. Clearly we cannot make all types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of pollution illegal, but if I dump nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste in my backyard, that is obviously a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem. Consequently, the libertarian solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pollution is fairly straightforward. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to stop me from polluting your property,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including making exscessive noise, you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prove actually damages arising directly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proximately from your actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In this case, actual damages might include
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increased crime, vanalism, traffic problems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disturbance, creating a hostile environment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actual damages might be measured in terms of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduced value of property, increased security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs, health costs, costs of cleaning up ,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs associated with traffic and reduced parking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunities. Of course on top of these are the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transaction costs associated with obtaining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damages, including court costs, opportunity costs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently, the petition is certainly an initiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of force, a prior restraint if you will. Let the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liquor store take on the risk. Let them go to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expense of building the place, stocking and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; staffing the place. If, it turns out that their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action causes actual damage to the condo owners,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then let them sue, proving actual damages (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I say either directly, or proximately by way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their customers) and let the liquor store either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clean up their actions, compensate sufficiently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or go away. Perhaps the condo owners could point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to the liquor store owner the potential of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lawsuit, so that the liquor store owner is fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aware of the potential costs associated with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential pollution. On this basis he can adequately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compensate, either by making restrictions on his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customers, negotiating a deal with the condo owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even choosing not to build.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, this mechanism is made rather more difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of transaction costs. Specifically the cost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a lawsuit is extremely high. However, the solution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here is not to arrogate more control to the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (by letting them decide these matters by zoning laws)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but rather to reduce the cost of a lawsuit, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by largely privatizing the court system.

<p>Greg Burch:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm overseas and on the run, but since there was a request for input from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;old timers&quot;, I'll take a quick crack at it . . .
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see the government action in the petition, per se.  The petition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself is just a form of speech, and an orderly one at that . . .  As for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PETITION scaring off investors, if a real estate developer's backers learn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the community doesn't support the development, then that seems like valuable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information to the investors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To the extent the petition is seen as a petition for the GOVERNMENT to ACT, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it can be seen as a minor initiation of force, or simply initiation of legal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process within the legal structure available.  I'd have to know more about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the due process available to the bar owner, the extent to which the gvt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action is governed by explicit law, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   (C) [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think Brian is right that this is the best choice, again depending on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors discussed in connection w/the previous point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;   (D) [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand this -- it just doesn't parse for me.  All disputes in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society involve a &quot;conflict of interest&quot; and that's what all of the various 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanisms of social control, libertarian or otherwise, are about.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Libertarian ethics&quot; are very much implicated in this dispute, if I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand your meaning.  And then the question becomes one of doing the best 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job one has of implementing one's ethics with the social structure available. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Thus, petitioning the government (especially as constrained by explicit, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fair law) is far more &quot;libertarian&quot; than, say, firebombing the property to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express the &quot;conflict of interest&quot;.

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Italy we cannot choose &quot;C&quot; (usually, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our past, present and future city governments).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we (libertarians or not, extropians or not)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose &quot;B&quot;, always. As I do.
</em><br>
<p>Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;C&quot; is the clear choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed.  The existing stake holders in any area or resource should have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right to some say regarding things they think will influence the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of their stake.   However you produce that effect consistent with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rights of the newcomer, this needs to be recognized and dealt with. 
</em><br>
<p>Natasha Vita-More:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I’ll answer Eli’s query as a deep-foggy rather than an old-timer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (while remembering that it is size that matters, not age.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I understand the setup correctly, the folks who live in condos
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are complaining that the bar will be too noisy and the issue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is how to they resolve the impending conflict. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a former homeowner, I remember attending town meetings and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listening the wranglings night after night.  I purchased a home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a commercial zone which was primarily residential, all resident
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew before purchasing their homes that this location would,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at some point, be developed.  I was there to turn my home into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a business that would have live music.  The fact that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lived in homes next to me was secondary to the fact that we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commercially zoned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The bottom line is this: If you purchase a piece of property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in close proximity to a business district, the community will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up dealing with how much revenue will come from the business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how much the town needs the business and who does or will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work for the business.  If the personality profile of the town
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is rowdy, rowdy will win.  It is a conservative or spiritual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community, then not too many folks will end up stooped at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bar.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The folks that purchase homes or condos near commercially zoned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas have to deal with the consequence development and growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Zoning laws may have community buffer zones which give residence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sort of padding between their homes and bustling businesses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  There are also zoning variances and ordinances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a person purchases a condominium or home which is near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; buffer zone or right smack up next to a commercial zone, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is part of the possible situations that can occur.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person does not want to be near a bar, then she or he needs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchase a homestead near a national forest which cannot be developed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  A commercially zoned location is zoned to the businesses that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the community desires regardless of who lives next door.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding noise, I believe in the 1970s Congress passed a Noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Control Act as a sort of template for local and state bodies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to use when designing their own regulations.  However, even my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; townhouse manager where we live doesn’t stop the noise pollution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming from the people across the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems that the resolution could be obtained through voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperation.  In that the idea is for the individuals involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have the power to decide, rather than a governing body, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still boils down to a set of values or guidelines that folks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have to follow.  So, if the community wants more business,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business will win.  If the community wants more spas and meditation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be a juice bar instead of martinis.
</em><br>
<p>Bradley Felton:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with &quot;A&quot;.  The condo-owners don't own the rights to the formerly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quiet lot across the street that they were enjoying the benefit of, anymore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a person on an airline &quot;owns&quot; the right to the empty seat next to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which they didn't purchase a ticket for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The legitimate way for the condo-owners to control their surrounding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment is to purchase it; then they could leave it forever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undeveloped, or turn it into rental units with strict noise rules, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever.
</em><br>
<p>Shirley Ulrich:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with (A).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Under the right set of circumstances, (C) might have merit.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= L. Neil Smith =
<br>
<p>L. Neil Smith is probably one of the most extreme Libertarians around, the
<br>
author of some reputable anarchocapitalist SF, and was recently the
<br>
Libertarian candidate for President in Arizona instead of Harry Browne.  I'm
<br>
not sure how that happened, but when I noted that, if nobody voted except in
<br>
Arizona, he could be the next President, he replied:  &quot;I'd be happy just to be
<br>
the president of Arizona.&quot;  It took me a few seconds to get that... but
<br>
definitely, an extreme Libertarian.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I was curious to know how the Confederacy would have handled this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     I agree that:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (A) Signing a petition to deny a liquor license is an improper use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  government mechanisms, constituting the initiation of force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     There is no such thing as a &quot;proper&quot; use of government mechanisms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If, indeed, the bar causes people in the neighborhood to lose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoyment of their own property, that's a purely civil matter, to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealt with _after_ the fact. Try it before, and you've got a police
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Which is also the case if you accept the idea of distributed noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights. Sound like Algore's ideas about carbon.
</em><br>
<p>[ I requested clarification on that last one - i.e., I defined &quot;noise rights&quot;
<br>
as buying the right to emit any decibels over 90 on a piece of property - and
<br>
he replied: ]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     I am, in fact, well aware of the concept of &quot;noise rights&quot;. I simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reject it.
</em><br>
<p>[ I'm not sure whether this means he thinks a noise-rights contract is morally
<br>
unenforceable, or whether settling this issue by buying up noise rights is
<br>
simply a bad idea.  I was surprised; I thought for sure that would be how the
<br>
Confederacy handled it. ]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Moshe Yudkowsky =
<br>
<p>Moshe Yudkowsky is my father.  I was raised to vote Libertarian, and was
<br>
somewhat curious to see what Dad would think of the issue.  (I should note
<br>
that Dad, though a Libertarian science-fiction fan, is decidedly *not* an
<br>
Extropian.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (E) (heh, heh)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [ Editor's note:  Typical. ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The question is property rights. Do the bar owners have the right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extend noise beyond their property line? Airplanes extend noise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere, how is this legal?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not anti-Libertarian to use the gov't to defend against infrigments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of property rights. That's what gov't is for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, in this case, the question of &quot;noise&quot; or &quot;noise pollution&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights haven't been clearly defined. What's the limit on the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise that one person can legally generate? Clearly noise at different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times has different values to different people (loud music in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afternoon, vs. the middle of the night, vs. the middle of the afternoon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when a night-shift worker is sleeping).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other effects: increased traffic, etc., are all part of a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; series of property rights issues (why is the street considered common property?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Houston, TX, does not have zoning laws, so there's no implied property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rights. Chicago does, and the property rights are enforced in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mannner. But they're not defined as property rights, and they get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tangled in the political atmosphere.
</em><br>
