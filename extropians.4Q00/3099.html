[Note from Matthew Gaylor: I've read nearly everything David Brin has 
<br>
in print and I highly recommend him. Brin is a scientist and 
<br>
bestselling novelist.  His 1989 thriller Earth  foresaw both global 
<br>
warming and the World Wide Web.  A movie with Kevin Costner was 
<br>
loosely based on &quot;The Postman&quot;. &quot;Startide Rising&quot; is in pre 
<br>
production at Paramount Pictures. Brin's non-fiction book -- &quot;The 
<br>
Transparent Society: Will Technology Make Us Choose Between Freedom 
<br>
and Privacy?&quot; -- deals with threats to openness and liberty in the 
<br>
new wired-age.  His speculations on the future of the Internet appear 
<br>
as the lead article in the latest issue of the American Bar

David's &quot;confessions&quot; don't raise the bristles of a few radicals,

<p>=======================
<br>
<p><p>CONFESSIONS OF A CHEERFUL LIBERTARIAN
<br>
<p>(A pragmatic-philosophical draft in progress)
<br>
<p>by David Brin, author of The Postman and The Transparent Society
<br>
<p><p>I get confused looks from some of my libertarian pals, when I say I'm 
<br>
one of them.
<br>
<p>On the one hand, I send money to the LP every year and routinely vote 
<br>
Libertarian in primary elections. I was even a keynote speaker at the 
<br>
California LP Convention, last year.
<br>
<p>On the other hand,  I admit turning around and often voting for 
<br>
Democrats in general elections. (I spoke on a privacy policy panel at 
<br>
their 2000 convention, in Los Angeles.)  I also send cash to 
<br>
Greenpeace and the ACLU. So what the hell am I?
<br>
<p>After serious thought, I can only conclude that I must be a... 
<br>
(shudder)... pragmatist.
<br>
<p>*
<br>
<p>No word is better guaranteed to offend those who love the memic 
<br>
pleasures of ideology. According to the deeply-rooted tradition of 
<br>
Plato, the world is made up of essences. Some may be right and others 
<br>
wrong, but any person worthy of respect must believe in some 
<br>
essential &quot;truth&quot;, some law or model of human nature, whether it's 
<br>
the labor theory of value or an absolute right of property.  Men of 
<br>
the True Right and True Left often respect each other on principle 
<br>
while disagreeing. Above all, they share contempt for wishy-washy 
<br>
types who see partial truths coming from all directions.
<br>
<p>Yep, those pure Platonic ideologies offer loads of satisfaction. But 
<br>
sorry, I can't join in.  I can't afford the luxury.  I have too many 
<br>
urgent needs for the present and goals for tomorrow.  I want those 
<br>
needs satisfied and those goals fulfilled, but the last century has 
<br>
proved again and again that ideologies aren't especially helpful at 
<br>
achieving practical goals.
<br>
<p>Moreover, recent advances in anthropology, neuroscience and 
<br>
complexity theory all converge toward one conclusion; even the most 
<br>
compelling or beguiling ideological description can never encompass 
<br>
the range of emergent and often contradictory qualities contained in 
<br>
a single human being, let alone whole societies.
<br>
<p>*
<br>
<p>What do I need right now?   Because I'm a brash eccentric, I need a 
<br>
society that is open, tolerant, even welcoming of eccentricity. One 
<br>
whose institutions are accountable enough to minimize the inevitable 
<br>
capricious power abuses that fester in every human culture.  One 
<br>
where competition takes place under conditions that maximize fair 
<br>
comparison of quality (in goods, services, and ideas) while 
<br>
minimizing the destructive effects of our most loathsome human trait 
<br>
-- our talent for rationalizing cheating and oppression.
<br>
<p>What do I want for tomorrow?  A world where coercion is minimized and 
<br>
individuals are free to achieve the maximum they can by making fair 
<br>
deals with each other, leveraging off others' talents and benefiting 
<br>
from the mutual criticism that only true freedom engenders.
<br>
<p>Now I concede -- heck, I avow! -- that these desiderata sound awfully 
<br>
libertarian.  But let's recall that, ironically, the same futurist 
<br>
dream was shared by idealizing Marxists!  They, too, envisioned a 
<br>
final destination without states or any coercive institutions, only 
<br>
human beings interacting autonomously.  The chief difference was 
<br>
always over the right path to achieve that envisioned paradise of 
<br>
emancipated individuals.  Marxists fantasized that it would emerge 
<br>
semi-violently from some &quot;final stage of industrial capitalization&quot; 
<br>
-- as if that ongoing task could ever be finished!  Libertarians, on 
<br>
the other hand, see the ultimate apotheosis of individualism coming 
<br>
as a result of...
<br>
<p>Well, here's where we have a problem, because there are some real 
<br>
contradictions that I seldom hear my libertarian friends talk about. 
<br>
Especially over the basic difference between evolution and revolution.
<br>
<p>Revolution is far more gut-satisfying and romantic, but in order to 
<br>
justify it, you must assume the worst. To hear some true-believers 
<br>
rail against today's society, you'd think we live in a wretched 
<br>
Orwellian dictatorship filled with bovine Democrats, porcine 
<br>
Republicans, and sheeplike voters, all of them too stupid to perceive 
<br>
the Truth.
<br>
<p>*
<br>
<p>I admit that I'm drawn to these characters, because of their 
<br>
admirable passion.  I find much that's appealing about their ardent 
<br>
dream of a better world.  Alas, their stern righteousness makes them 
<br>
irresistible targets for playful teasing.  For instance, I find that 
<br>
nothing causes these delightfully articulate firebrands to go 
<br>
tongue-locked more efficiently than asking the following question. 
<br>
Can you name one human civilization, past or present, that was even 
<br>
half as close to what you desire as contemporary America is today?
<br>
<p>Like their spiritual cousins -- radical feminists -- these fellows 
<br>
enjoy the indignant rush of knowing they are right.  And like radical 
<br>
feminists, they find it galling to be reminded how far freedom has 
<br>
already come. Or how this culture seems almost designed to bring them 
<br>
about. Or that their citizenship may have real value in a 
<br>
civilization that -- while still flawed -- is nevertheless more 
<br>
hope-filled and worthy of the name than any other.  A civilization 
<br>
that seems already to be moving in the direction they desire.
<br>
<p>*
<br>
<p>In light of where I'm first publishing this draft-in-progress -- in a 
<br>
libertarian Science Fiction newsletter -- let's narrow the discussion 
<br>
down to that very topicä portrayals of libertarianism in science 
<br>
fiction.
<br>
<p>I contend that most libertarian SF is similar, at heart, to 
<br>
radical-feminist SF, sharing roots that run far deeper than their 
<br>
superficially disparate political prescriptions.  Both perceive a 
<br>
desperate need to tear out a pervasive evil -- root and branch -- 
<br>
replacing it with something much more uncomplicated and, in the 
<br>
author's view, more inherently 'natural.' It's all part of a grand 
<br>
tradition of polemical, rather than exploratory science fiction. 
<br>
Instead of suggesting realistic but tedious possibilities for gradual 
<br>
reform, both libertarian and feminist SF often focus on 
<br>
wish-fantasies portraying one paramount dream -- simplification 
<br>
through revolution.
<br>
<p>Take a glance at the most popular works in both sub-genres.  Plot 
<br>
scenarios nearly always revolve around chopping away society's 
<br>
complex institutional structures, replacing them with a thumbnail 
<br>
prescription simple enough to fit on a few pages and to be imposed by 
<br>
a few super-competent, ubermensch protagonists -- heroes who can 
<br>
dispense with accountability because their inherent virtues make it 
<br>
unnecessary.  Only instead of the 'kindly matriarchs' who take over 
<br>
after some devastating war or disease (a chief cliche in feminist 
<br>
novels), the most hackneyed archetype in libertarian Science Fiction 
<br>
features rebellious space colonies, cutting their ties to decadent 
<br>
old Earth and proclaiming some trimmed-down utopia in orbit, setting 
<br>
themselves proudly aloof from the misguided and unredeemable masses 
<br>
festering below.
<br>
<p>(Of course, now that Earthers have been warned in advance by such 
<br>
novels, citizens will act to prevent rebellion by ungrateful 
<br>
astronauts. They'll accomplish this by the simple means of choosing 
<br>
adults to crew space stations, instead of boys obsessed with 
<br>
hotwiring mobile homes in space.)
<br>
<p><p>Why do simplification-fantasies have such a powerful draw, sinking 
<br>
their hooks into us again and again, no matter repetitiously or even 
<br>
preposterously they are told?  Pondering this subject, I realize I 
<br>
have more questions than answers.  (One true sign of an infuriating 
<br>
pragmatist non-ideologue, I'm afraid!)  So I did the obvious... I 
<br>
wrote a questionnaire!
<br>
<p>Drop by <a href="http://www.kithrup.com/brin/">http://www.kithrup.com/brin/</a> (or <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/">http://www.davidbrin.com/</a> ) 
<br>
and see my &quot;questionnaire on ideology&quot;.  It was written to explore 
<br>
some deep assumptions that run -- like underground rivers -- below 
<br>
many political systems.  For example: how did you arrive at your 
<br>
beliefs?  People tend to credit their own convictions to logical 
<br>
appraisal of the facts, while blaming their opponents' obdurate 
<br>
mistaken dogmas on intrinsic character flaws, or else conformity to 
<br>
malignant propaganda.  (Look it up, this tendency is ubiquitous! Your 
<br>
foes are just as confident in their own logic - and your illogic - as 
<br>
you are in reverse.)
<br>
<p>Does the commonly held libertarian self-image - as a doctrine arising 
<br>
solely from evidence and reason -- really hold?  The answer may 
<br>
embarrass you.
<br>
<p>For example, do you want to talk about propaganda? I'll show you 
<br>
propaganda! Modern western media messages -- e.g. in nearly every 
<br>
Hollywood movie -- emphasize in-your-face individualism and suspicion 
<br>
of authority, pounding these themes more relentlessly than any other 
<br>
motif in human history.  Never before has an idea been given such 
<br>
play!  So might our libertarian attitudes actually arise from this 
<br>
everpresent indoctrination?  From lessons we've imbibed since 
<br>
childhood, suckling them from the teat of a society that is much less 
<br>
conformist and more cherishing of individualism than we let ourselves 
<br>
imagine?
<br>
<p>When I mention this in public, some audience members greet the 
<br>
apparent paradox with displeasure, even anger.  It's discomfiting to 
<br>
imagine that a proudly singular trait might have arisen from 
<br>
relentless propaganda!  How much more satisfying to say to yourself 
<br>
-- &quot;I invented individualism and rebellion!&quot;
<br>
<p>Others, faced with overpowering evidence -- their own memories of 
<br>
every movie and novel they ever enjoyed -- abruptly break into 
<br>
smiles, even chuckles, over the rich irony.  These alphas, true 
<br>
individualists, don't feel threatened or shamed by the insightä by 
<br>
realizing that they were taught - even programmed - to be eccentrics 
<br>
and rebels.
<br>
<p>So society wants them to be unconventional and defy authority?  Well, 
<br>
then, so be it!  So this civilization is healthier than they had 
<br>
imagined.  Fine.  So what?
<br>
<p>The past is over, as far as they are concerned. All that matters is 
<br>
what's ahead.
<br>
<p>*
<br>
<p>Hence the name I give my own brand of libertarianism... Cheerful 
<br>
Libertarianism!
<br>
<p>Angry types tend to think that an individualist paradise has been 
<br>
prevented. That we are kept away from some natural state of grace by 
<br>
because a grievous sin (in this case, government) that can only be 
<br>
overcome through revolution.  They believe this, never noticing the 
<br>
quasi-religiosity of their philosophy, or the old-fashioned righteous 
<br>
satisfaction that it offers.
<br>
<p>Cheerful Libertarianism takes a diametrically opposite view -- that 
<br>
the natural human condition for thousands of years has been either 
<br>
gruesomely oppressive feudalism or Lord-of-the-Flies chaos.  Only 
<br>
now, after a near-uniform worldwide tale of repression and woe, 
<br>
things seem to be changing at last, in important ways!
<br>
<p>Our present high levels of freedom, tolerance, individual 
<br>
eccentricity and general rambunctiousness are unprecedented and 
<br>
growing at incredible rates.  Instead of being fallen creatures, we 
<br>
seem to be riding a rapidly rising tide, aimed toward incredible 
<br>
levels of self-actualization, individual achievement and liberty for 
<br>
all people.  Moreover, the society that got us this far -- though 
<br>
fraught with troubles and occasional outrages -- just might be pretty 
<br>
good compared to everything that came before, offering an excellent 
<br>
platform to evolve toward better things.
<br>
<p>Here's a thought that might revolutionize modern libertarianism: 
<br>
perhaps our fellow citizens aren't insipid fools after all!
<br>
<p>Maybe the bulky government that they've repeatedly voted for isn't 
<br>
intrinsically vile, but rather an awkward, intermediate necessity. A 
<br>
stage in a general evolutionary process, along the way from native 
<br>
chaos-and-feudalism toward a world of genuinely open opportunity that 
<br>
our brainy, hyper-educated grandchildren will take for granted.
<br>
<p>Instead of railing about how stupid our fellow citizens have been, 
<br>
Cheerful Libertarianism congratulates them on how far they managed to 
<br>
come using such gross and crudely inefficient tools.
<br>
<p>Only now (we add) it's time to outgrow those complicated and 
<br>
coercive, bureaucracy-heavy tools!  For example: universal education 
<br>
in state schools helped uplift prior generations out of illiterate 
<br>
class systems, resulting in unprecedented numbers of high school and 
<br>
college graduates and a trained workforce capable of producing the 
<br>
modern techno-corucopia; but now a lack of choice is preventing 
<br>
further progress by stifling educational innovations that might arise 
<br>
out of more sophisticated and agile competition.
<br>
<p>Our point should be that simplistic &quot;government-centered solutions&quot; 
<br>
that once worked, in a more primitive world, may now be obsolete and 
<br>
holding us back.  With rising sophistication, we can move on to more 
<br>
mature synergies that make progressively less use of coercive state 
<br>
power, leveraging against individual effort more and more as time 
<br>
goes on.
<br>
<p>People might actually vote for such a message!  A message that 
<br>
congratulates them for their past successes with crude implements, 
<br>
while insisting that the future should be different, because we are 
<br>
ready now to use the versatile toolkit of self-reliance.  A message 
<br>
filled with ideas that are pragmatic, incremental, perhaps even 
<br>
accepting of compromise, yet always applying pressure in the 
<br>
direction of less coercion, less bureaucracy and more reliance on the 
<br>
creativity of autonomous human beings.
<br>
<p>One thing is certain, the present approach of contemptuously railing 
<br>
at voters isn't working. They do not -- and won't ever -- cast 
<br>
ballots for candidates who call them fools (explicitly or 
<br>
implicitly), relentlessly repeating the standard, self righteous 
<br>
rant. A rant that says this gentle, prosperous, tolerant, improving 
<br>
civilization is actually a cesspit of brutality and despair.  Oh 
<br>
please.
<br>
<p>Yes, the rant feels good.  But I want to see freedom-loving 
<br>
candidates actually gain some power.  So here's an idea.  Let's 
<br>
replace the failed harangue with a message offering our fellow 
<br>
citizens both congratulations and new hope.  Hope that we can rise 
<br>
even faster toward a future of freedom and opportunity for all.
<br>
<p><p><p>================= footnote ===================
<br>
<p>* &quot;...As a avowed libertarian, I am nevertheless very much a heretic 
<br>
-- one who believes that a future of fully emancipated individualism 
<br>
will be far better achieved through pragmatic evolution -- by 
<br>
continuing the Periclean/Galilean traditions that were exemplified 
<br>
and expanded-upon by the Scottish-English Enlightenment -- as opposed 
<br>
to the far more common prescription of idealistic revolution touted 
<br>
by French, German and Russian philosophers.  In novels such as Earth 
<br>
and The Postman, as well as non-fiction (The Transparent Society), I 
<br>
tend to frown on the broadbrushed Platonic essences that enthrall Ayn 
<br>
Rand's most ardent followers....&quot;   For more on this, see: &quot;A

thriller Earth  foresaw both global warming and the World Wide Web. 
<br>
A movie with Kevin Costner was loosely based on The Postman. Startide

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brin's non-fiction book --  The Transparent Society: Will

threats to openness and liberty in the new wired-age.  His 
<br>
speculations on the future of the Internet appear as the lead article 
<br>
in the latest issue of the American Bar Association's Journal on 
<br>
Dispute Resolution.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brin's latest novel, Foundation's Triumph, brings to a grand 
<br>
finale -- and ties up all the loose ends -- in Isaac Asimov's famed 
<br>
Foundation Universe.  He has won three Hugo Awards and has been 
<br>
nominated more than a dozen times.

<p>[Matthew Gaylor's response to &quot;Confessions of a Cheerful 
<br>
Libertarian&quot;-   David Brin wrote: &quot;To hear some true-believers rail 
<br>
against today's society, you'd think we live in a wretched Orwellian 
<br>
dictatorship filled with bovine Democrats, porcine Republicans, and 
<br>

<br>
say confessions are good for the soul, but I'm not too sure after 
<br>
reading David Brin's. &quot;The evils of tyranny are rarely seen but by 
<br>
him who resists it.&quot; -- John Hay, 1872.  In my home town of Columbus, 
<br>
Ohio there currently is a graffiti artist running loose writing the 
<br>
slogan &quot;No More Prisons&quot; on freeway underpasses and other structures. 
<br>
I happened to catch a TV news report detailing the activity.  What 
<br>
stuck me as absurd was the closing comment of the TV personality, who 
<br>
said something to the effect &quot;And nobody seems to know what &quot;No More 
<br>
Prisons&quot; means. I think &quot;too stupid to perceive the truth&quot; sums up 
<br>
what is wrong with Brin's cheerful outlook.
<br>
While I share much of his optimism and eager anticipation of 
<br>
technology changing the world, I refuse to forget that the US 
<br>
Corrections System currently has 458,000 Drug War Prisoners. Plus the 
<br>
number of people under some form of correctional supervision -- jail, 
<br>
prison, probation, or parole -- has reached a record 6.3 million. Go 
<br>

This isn't a libertarian fantasy.  This is reality.  Smoke a joint 
<br>
and go to jail, and expect the state to seize your children and place 
<br>
them in a foster home. Or go ask Peter McWilliams if he thinks we 
<br>
live in a Police State?  You can't because he is dead, as he said 
<br>
&quot;They're just going to let me die,&quot; the New York Times best-selling 
<br>
author said who used medical marijuana to alleviate the side effects 
<br>
of the AIDS wasting syndrome and the nausea associated ...But who was 
<br>
prevented by the state to alleviate his suffering and died as a 
<br>
result (See <a href="http://www.mcwilliams.com/">http://www.mcwilliams.com/</a> ) Or go ask the thousands of 
<br>
innocent gun owners robbed of their rights by legislative control 
<br>
freaks. Or go ask the FBI why they pumped tear gas into the Branch 
<br>
Davidian Church full of small children thus setting off a chain 
<br>
reaction that ultimately incinerated them.  If you're not satisfied 
<br>
with their answer you might want to ask them about carnivore and 
<br>
their plans to do wholesale spying on American citizens.  I could go 
<br>
on at length, but surely I'm not imagining this, am I?]
