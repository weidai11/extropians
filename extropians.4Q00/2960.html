<p>D'oh!  I knew that.  Actually, it would be more accurate to say that I've

*heard* that, but the version I keep on remembering is &quot;You can't win, you

<p>Double d'oh!  I remember that too - or think I do; can't trust LTM. 
<br>
Wasn't there a name for phase space, though?  M-something?  I can't find
<br>
it on the 'Net, though, and &quot;phase space&quot; is something for which it's
<br>
really convenient to have a single word.
<br>
<p>Incidentally, one formulation I've run across online is that the
<br>
&quot;Hamiltonian&quot; refers to the (6N-1)D surface in (6N)D phase space with
<br>
constant energy, with the (as it turns out) first law of thermodynamics
<br>
referring to a constraint on the trajectory through phase space; i.e., any
<br>
individual point must move along the Hamiltonian hypersurface that has
<br>
constant energy.  The memory I seem to remember having is that the
<br>
&quot;Hamiltonian&quot; is the (6N+1)D hypersurface that shows the energy as a
<br>
function of phase space and is used locally to describe potential energy
<br>
surfaces.  Sigh... I either need to actually read my set of the Feynman
<br>
lectures, find a good physics encyclopedia, or give up physical science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, some more substantive comments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The negative-energy PMM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paul Davies talks about negative-energy perpetual motion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machines at <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980321/features.html">http://www.newscientist.com/ns/980321/features.html</a>,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with the extra influences that would stop them working.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;RANT&gt;
<br>
<p>Paul Davies sez:  &quot;It is easy to dream up scenarios that produce
<br>
unphysical or paradoxical consequences--building perpetual motion
<br>
machines, or even travelling backwards in time. To physicists, these are
<br>
alarming notions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Who knows, Davies may turn out to be right; but even so, this strikes me
<br>
as the sort of thing that future historians call a 'blind spot', like the
<br>
unbreakability of the sound barrier or the impossibility of
<br>
heavier-than-air flight.  &quot;Despite numerous demonstrations that their own
<br>
theories permitted the possibility of time travel / negative energy /
<br>
naked singularities etc., twentieth-century physicists still refused to
<br>
believe, calling them 'alarming notions'.&quot;  This rant is more about time
<br>
travel then about thermodynamics, but real physical laws don't look like
<br>
they're about to be violated every second Tuesday.  Sometimes physics
<br>
fights back, as when it turns out that the Alcubierre warp drive required
<br>
more energy than existed in the entire Universe, but sometimes the Cosmic
<br>
Censorship patches turn out to be equally flawed themselves - the
<br>
Alcubierre drive was replaced by the Van Den Broeck drive, and so on.  The
<br>
original &quot;Cosmic Censorship&quot; hypothesis preventing naked singularities
<br>
also turned out to be flawed, as I recall.
<br>
<p>Real physical laws, like conservation of mass and energy, are not
<br>
preserved by all these Cosmic Censorship patches; the global law is the
<br>
result of the absolute firmness of the local law.  Paul Davies talks about
<br>
&quot;permissible fluctuations in entropy&quot;, but did you ever hear of a
<br>
permissible fluctuation in mass-energy?
<br>
<p>If current physical theory offends a physicist, so what?  God does play
<br>
dice with the Universe, Einstein, get over it.  Even the more imaginative
<br>
physicists, like David Deutsch, suffer from the same disease, confining
<br>
closed timelike curves to quantum universes and so on.  Time travel,
<br>
*including* global causality violation, is explicitly permitted by General
<br>
Relativity.  Physicists will just need to learn to deal with it.
<br>
<p>Oh, never mind.  I'm not a physicist.  You can get personally annoyed with
<br>
physical theories, but you're supposed to buy the right to do so with a
<br>
physics doctorate.  This system works so well generally that I would have
<br>
no real objection to being slapped down by it personally.  Not my job.
<br>
<p>&lt;/RANT&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would take issue with the description of phase space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here. Suppose you have a world in which particles can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created and destroyed. This doesn't mean that phase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space changes in size each time that happens, it means that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phase space is the union of zero-particle phase space,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-particle phase space, two-particle phase space, etc.;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and when a particle is created, you move from the N-particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region to the (N+1)-particle region.
</em><br>
<p>This is an interesting way of looking at it.  It looks to me like
<br>
particles being created and destroyed - in particular, negative-energy and
<br>
positive-energy particles annihilating, as opposed to matter-antimatter
<br>
interactions which give rise to gamma rays or other new particles - are
<br>
intrinsically many-to-one or one-to-many rather than one-to-one.  As I
<br>
understand it, there is no way to predict, from the current state of the
<br>
Universe, where a negative and positive particle pair will come into
<br>
existence; thus the current phase-space point of the Universe can give
<br>
rise to multiple points at the next instant - one possible alternate point
<br>
for each place a virtual particle pair can pop up.  Similarly, a virtual
<br>
pair (&quot;virtual pair&quot; in the negative-positive, not matter-antimatter,
<br>
sense) can annihilate either over *here* or over *there*, and the state of
<br>
the Universe will be same either way, since neither particle exists any
<br>
more - a many-to-one interaction.  It's an interesting question whether
<br>
this same objection applies to Feynman diagrams; that is, whether a
<br>
positron and electron can collide in two different ways and give rise to
<br>
precisely the same gamma particle.  I myself don't know.
<br>
<p>(As Hal Finney from &quot;Extropians&quot; put it:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However I'm not sure it makes sense to explain that the whole idea works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because of increasing the volume of phase space due to adding particles.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If all it took to violate thermodynamic laws were to change the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of particles, it would happen all the time.  Chemical reactions change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number of molecules, which is often what we count in thermodynamics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and nuclear reactions can change the number of subatomic particles.
</em><br>
<p>)
<br>
<p>Anyway.
<br>
<p>There are two possible ways that entropy could be conserved; either the
<br>
method of manufacturing negative matter could intrinsically create as much
<br>
additional entropy (through one-to-many interactions) as could be
<br>
destroyed by annihilating the matter (through many-to-one interactions);
<br>
or, it could be demonstrated that phase space really is unified and all
<br>
interactions involved are one-to-one; that is, no two different
<br>
annihilations will give rise to the same state of post-annihilation
<br>
Universe.
<br>
<p>It's hard to tell which theory is represented by Paul Davies's Censorship
<br>
objections, but I would guess the former, since he does talk about
<br>
&quot;permissible fluctuations in entropy&quot;.  Paul Davies's objections seem to
<br>
show that if you try and take a beam of negative energy and use it to cool
<br>
something off, or if you try to go somewhere where there's a lot of
<br>
negative energy, you'll get hit by at least as much positive energy as
<br>
negative.  This is not too surprising - conservation of mass-energy says
<br>
that positive energy has to show up somewhere.  My specific suggestion
<br>
relied on actually manufacturing negative *matter*, not just beams or
<br>
regions of negative energy - which, confessably, is a much less analyzable
<br>
proposal since there's much more real analysis of negative *energy* than
<br>
negative *matter*.  Nonetheless, physicists do make proposals relying on
<br>
negative matter, not just negative energy, and I recall that some
<br>
manufacturing proposals have been made.  The lynchpin of my proposal is
<br>
not to just cool down matter with a negative-energy beam; it is to use the
<br>
negative and positive matter as actual heat sinks for the entropy of your
<br>
laced positive-matter and negative-matter Solar-System-sized computer,
<br>
then throw the matter away.  In particular, it would be interesting to see
<br>
what Paul Davies would make of a proposal to transfer entropy to the
<br>
negative energy or positive energy itself before it annihilated, rather
<br>
than directing negative energy at an external target.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - The quantum collapse PMM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The proposal here is pretty vague. It's just, 'what if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entropy-increasing processes somehow acquired very low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is a 'quantum thermodynamics', it's called statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanics, and entropy still increases there. There's interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent work in quantum information theory which suggests that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entropy and entanglement are related, and maybe there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinctively quantum ways to *locally* decrease entropy ... but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there's no inkling of a global violation of the second law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once again on phase space ... You can conceive of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quantum state as a wavefunction on a classical state space,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or as a point in Hilbert space, but in neither case does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'phase space'(*) itself change size when a wavefunction collapses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the first case, the wavefunction is suddenly restricted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small region of state space; in the second case, the state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vector jumps to a different point in Hilbert space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (*) Technically, I'd rather say 'configuration space', since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   phase space refers to a space which has a position *and*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   a momentum coordinate for each degree of freedom, and neither
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Hilbert space nor the space upon which a wavefunction is based
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   is like that.
</em><br>
<p>The key feature of the proposal is not that the phase space changes sizes;
<br>
that is simply one way of looking at the underlying &quot;problem&quot;, which is
<br>
that multiple points in phase space move to single points in phase space. 
<br>
E.g., an electron with a .8 probability amplitude of being at A and a .6i
<br>
amplitude of being at B, and an electron with a .9 amplitude of being at A
<br>
and a .4i amplitude of being at B, can both collapse to having a 1
<br>
amplitude of being at A.
<br>
<p>Hal Finney's objection in the parallel Universe of &quot;Extropians&quot; is quoted
<br>
here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you think of a many worlds model, any such attempt would not actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blip any other universes out of existence, but rather it simply allows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to learn where you are in the multiverse.  Learning where you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't change the overall statistics of what happens.  So I think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blipping-out is a bad model and misleading about what could happen.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is, of course, that the many-worlds model just isn't true.  If
<br>
quantum collapse were an observational-effect illusion, it would make no
<br>
difference what the probability amplitudes were; we would have the same
<br>
observed chance of winding up in a .2 probability Universe as a .8
<br>
probability Universe.  In this case, of course, my proposed method for
<br>
entropy disposal would totally fail.
<br>
<p>Hal Finney's objection could be resurrected by pointing out that
<br>
decreasing the probability of high-entropy Universes, or increasing the
<br>
probability of low-entropy Universes, could require that a superposed
<br>
state learn how much entropy it has, which - in turn - could turn out to
<br>
generate more entropy than could be disposed of.  After all, getting
<br>
particular states to add up or cancel out has to happen *before* the
<br>
quantum collapse.  That would be a classic Censorship patch.  It might be
<br>
possible, however, to generate all the self-observation entropy in the
<br>
high-entropy superposed states that are cancelling themselves out, thus
<br>
getting around that objection as well.
<br>
<p>My mental visualization here is not a Maxwell's demon situation, but
<br>
something more &quot;emergent&quot; - some way of ensuring, e.g., that electrons
<br>
which all happen to be moving in the same direction, have amplitudes that
<br>
build up, while electrons which happen to be moving in different
<br>
directions have amplitudes that cancel out.  From the internal,
<br>
pre-collapse perspective, no entropy violation has occurred.  Let's say
<br>
there are two electrons.  There are four superposed states where the
<br>
electrons are moving in the same direction, and four superposed states
<br>
where the electrons are moving in opposite directions.  It's just that the
<br>
first four superposed states all have amplitudes of .8i, while the second
<br>
four superposed states have amplitudes of .8i, -.8, -.8i, and .8
<br>
respectively, cancelling each other out.  In which case you could create a
<br>
crystal in which quantum effects turned heat directly into electricity,
<br>
although it might not be direct current, or at least not direct current of
<br>
a predictable direction, as that would violate CPT.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - The time-travelling Maxwell's-demon PMM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This I haven't quite heard before, although I daresay someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who studies wormholes has thought about thermodynamics in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wormhole spacetimes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But there's a hidden energy cost in waiting for the low-entropy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states to come along. It takes energy to register the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state and decide whether it's low entropy. So entropy will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generated by the selection process. This is the parable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maxwell's demon.
</em><br>
<p>Maxwell's demon applies to individual particles, rather than whole
<br>
systems.  Different rules might apply if you're willing to wait a
<br>
&quot;decillion&quot; years to get your low-entropy state.  In other words, it could
<br>
be that the entropy cost of Maxwell's demon making one &quot;selection&quot; is
<br>
constant, and that it's performing the repeated discrimination on each and
<br>
every particle that defeats the process.  Of course, it's just as possible
<br>
that constructing a demon which will actually last for a &quot;decillion&quot; -
<br>
I'll just say &quot;zillion&quot; - years would cost far more than any useful work
<br>
that could be gained from the system.
<br>
<p>But your objection is probably correct; e.g., performing a discrimination,
<br>
or continually checking for one, on an entire physical system, could
<br>
easily turn out to have entropy costs far in excess of entropy gained.
<br>
<p>A more interesting idea is this:  Perform the Maxwell's Demon
<br>
discrimination, extract the information, send the information backwards in
<br>
time, and then don't perform the costly process that got you the
<br>
information in the first place.  This throws away entropy into a future
<br>
that gets wiped out of existence by tampering with the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for phase space here ... the Hamiltonian framework describes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the state of the universe by a point in phase space, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history of the universe by a path in phase space. A universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with time travel is probably better described in some other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, since it likely can't be divided up into a simple series
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of 'spacelike surfaces', it will have some more complicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topology.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's what I see as a possible opportunity for violating the usual
<br>
&quot;conservation of phase space volume&quot; rules.
