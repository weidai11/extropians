<br>

<p>==
<br>
<p>No description of the physical world that is less complex than the entire
<br>
world can be perfect.  If you drop a glass, it will fall... unless all the
<br>
air molecules underneath it happen to simultaneously move upward and
<br>
strike the glass, while all the air molecules above it happen to be
<br>
elsewhere for a few moments - in which case the glass might hover in the
<br>
air, or move upwards instead.  It can happen.  The classical laws of
<br>
physics are CPT invariant; if you play a movie backward, everything that
<br>
happens in it will still conserve mass-energy, momentum, and Newton's laws
<br>
of gravitation.  A shattered glass could leap off the ground, onto the
<br>
table, and reassemble itself, if the molecules happened to be position
<br>
exactly the right way.  This is so enormously improbable, however - and
<br>
far beyond our present art to achieve artificially - that we are forced to
<br>
assume that we are watching a movie being played backward, and not a
<br>
genuine recording of an event, because while the event is physically
<br>
possible, it would be expected to take vastly longer than the age of the
<br>
Universe for anyone to capture it on film.
<br>
<p>The statement that glasses fall down, rather than up, is effectively
<br>
perfect.  &quot;Effectively perfect&quot; statements do not hold in all times and
<br>
all places.  If you live forever... not billions of years, or trillions of
<br>
years, but *forever*... you will eventually see it happen, not just once,
<br>
but many times.  The statement &quot;glasses fall down&quot; will, eventually, fall
<br>
down itself.
<br>
<p>The Turing diagonalization argument proves that absolute self-knowledge is
<br>
impossible, at least for computable processes.  Nonetheless, if a
<br>
transhuman can have &quot;effectively perfect&quot; self-knowledge or effectively
<br>
perfect sanity, they will - in all probability - run into no problems for
<br>
the first few decillion years... and as long as the amount of RAM keeps
<br>
increasing, they need fear nothing, indefinitely.  (The probability of a
<br>
nonrecoverable error occurring, integrated over infinite time, can be made
<br>
arbitrarily small.)  This follows from the mathematics of effective
<br>
perfection, or &quot;fuzzy phase space theory&quot;.  First, an introduction to
<br>
classical phase spaces.
<br>
<p>-- Begin expository lump:  Hot metal phase space --
<br>
<p>The first law of thermodynamics states that &quot;You can't win&quot;; you cannot
<br>
decrease the amount of entropy in the Universe.  This follows from a
<br>
theorem which states that, under the classical laws of physics, the volume
<br>
of any phase space is preserved as the system evolves.  The Hamiltonian of
<br>
a three-dimensional Newtonian system is a hugely multi-dimensional space,
<br>
which has six dimensions per particle; thus, a Newtonian Universe with
<br>
only 10 particles has a Hamiltonian with sixty dimensions.  Each x, y, and
<br>
z dimension describing the (a) particle position and (b) particle
<br>
velocity, for each individual particle, is a separate dimension of the
<br>
Hamiltonian.  Every possible state of this Newtonian Universe, any
<br>
possible combination of positions and velocities for the 20 particles in
<br>
it, is a single point within the Hamiltonian.  The evolution of the entire
<br>
Newtonian Universe, particles attracting and repelling each other, causes
<br>
the positions and velocities to change; the point moves around in the
<br>
Hamiltonian.  If the positions and velocities are continuous, which is
<br>
always true of a Newtonian Universe, then the point will follow a
<br>
continuous path within the Hamiltonian as the Newtonian Universe evolves.
<br>
<p>The theorem responsible for the first law of thermodynamics says that,
<br>
under certain laws of physics (including our classical laws), the volume
<br>
of a phase space is constant.  If you take eighty hypercubic centimeters
<br>
of phase space and evolve each point in that volume for N minutes, you
<br>
will have eighty hypercubic centimeters at the end of it.  The volume may
<br>
start out as a very compact shape, say a sphere, and wind up spread all
<br>
over the place with all kinds of hyperdimensional wrinkles, but the volume
<br>
will still be eighty hypercubic centimeters.
<br>
<p>Hence, the first law of thermodynamics.  A high-entropy system occupies a
<br>
large volume of phase space.  A hot piece of metal occupies a larger
<br>
volume of phase space than a cold piece of metal, since the range of
<br>
possible velocities for a particle is larger.  A physical process which
<br>
turned a hot piece of metal into a cold piece of metal plus electricity -
<br>
leaving the rest of the Universe constant - would be a process that turned
<br>
a large area of phase space into a small area, violating the theorem. 
<br>
Actually, in fact, each individual piece of hot metal or cold metal
<br>
occupies exactly one point within phase space; however, the *class* of
<br>
pieces of hot metal occupies a much larger volume of phase space then the
<br>
*class* of pieces of cold metal.  Thus, a process that turns hot metal *in
<br>
general* into cold metal *in general* is impossible under classical
<br>
physics; an individual piece of hot metal could conceivable turn into cold
<br>
metal plus electricity.  It is simply enormously *improbable* that any
<br>
given piece of hot metal will turn out to occupy one of the vanishingly
<br>
rare sub-volumes of &quot;hot metal phase space&quot; which will evolve into &quot;cold
<br>
metal phase space&quot; after some known amount of time (say, five minutes). 
<br>
In fact, the phase space volume of &quot;a piece of cold metal heated by
<br>
electricity&quot; will evolve into an equally small sub-volume of &quot;hot metal
<br>
phase space&quot;.  But it isn't a compact sub-volume - not one that's easy to
<br>
describe by any method known to humanity - so we treat this information as
<br>
being lost, and say that the cold metal has now entered &quot;hot metal phase
<br>
space&quot; in general.
<br>
<p>The three types of perpetual motion machine which violate the first law
<br>
all take advantage of loopholes in the theorem with respect to our actual,
<br>
nonclassical laws of physics.  (As far as I know, all three types are my
<br>
own invention, or reinvention.)
<br>
<p>The first type of perpetual motion machine, the negative-energy method,
<br>
says that you can manufacture X amount of negative matter, X amount of
<br>
positive matter, pour all your waste heat into the newly created matter,
<br>
and then annihilate it, getting rid of the waste heat.  Each time a
<br>
negative particle and a positive particle come into existence, it changes
<br>
the total volume of the Hamiltonian phase space - by adding entire
<br>
dimensions, in fact.  When you annihilate the particles, the total volume
<br>
shrinks again.  In effect, the Type One perpetual motion machine increases
<br>
the total volume of the Universe's Hamiltonian, which means that you can
<br>
choose to wind up in a smaller area (relatively speaking) of that larger
<br>
Hamiltonian.  Then you shrink the Hamiltonian back down again by
<br>
annihilating the matter, but you do so in a way which means that you end
<br>
up in a smaller area of your own Hamiltonian.  In other words, when you
<br>
increase the size of the Hamiltonian, you perform a one-to-one
<br>
transformation of your phase space into that Hamiltonian; then, when the
<br>
Hamiltonian shrinks, you perform a many-to-one transformation; taken as a
<br>
complete operation, this shrinks the size of your phase space.
<br>
<p>The second type of perpetual motion machine, the quantum, notes that
<br>
state-vector reduction again reduces the volume of phase space.  A large
<br>
volume of phase space, describing the probability amplitude that an
<br>
electron is present at all points of space, collapses into a single point
<br>
which describes the electron as being present at a single point in space. 
<br>
State-vector reduction takes zillions of possible superposed Universes and
<br>
annihilates all but one of them.  Thus, it may be possible to build a
<br>
quantum perpetual motion machine in which the amplitudes &quot;cold states&quot;
<br>
tend to add up while the amplitudes of &quot;hot states&quot; cancel out;
<br>
effectively, this dumps waste heat into a superposed state that gets
<br>
blipped out of existence when the quantum collapse occurs.
<br>
<p>The third type of perpetual motion machine, the temporal, says that you
<br>
can violate the first law using a time machine.  If you take a heat bath
<br>
and watch it evolving through states for a sufficiently long time, you can
<br>
decide to stop watching at a point where all the atoms on one side happen
<br>
to be moving in the same direction.  The volume of phase space has been
<br>
preserved at all points within the temporal loop, but from the perspective
<br>
of the rest of the Universe, the heat bath rejoins our world only when it
<br>
occupies a particular volume of phase space.  Pieces of a sufficiently
<br>
large physical system will show temporary decreases in entropy due to the
<br>
operation of normal, random mechanisms; a time machine lets you take all
<br>
the temporary decreases, unsynchronize them temporally, and resynchronize
<br>
them so that they all add together.  In other words, the phase space
<br>
remains constant if you evolve *all* of it for N minutes, but if you
<br>
evolve some of it for N minutes and some of it for M minutes, the new
<br>
volumes may overlap; the total volume may not be constant.
<br>
<p>-- End expository lump:  Hot metal phase space --
<br>
<p>In saying that a dropped glass will fall downwards, we are making a
<br>
statement that one volume of phase space - the phase space of dropped
<br>
glasses - will evolve into another phase space; the phase space of glasses
<br>
lying on the floor.  Both volumes of phase space are extremely large, but
<br>
they are relatively compact, and a point in the core volume of the first
<br>
phase space ends up in the core volume of the second phase space, *most of
<br>
the time* - they are fuzzy, but not very fuzzy.  The phase spaces are
<br>
compact and their evolution is compact, but will never be perfectly
<br>
compact in an inperfect Universe.  Watch long enough, and you'll see
<br>
glasses falling upwards.
<br>
<p>This phenomenon is what people refer to when they say that perfectly
<br>
rational thought is impossible.  Rational thought is the ability to model,
<br>
predict, and manipulate the regularities in physical reality.  Formally,
<br>
this is an attempt to describe a huge amount of information - the Universe
<br>
- with a small amount of information - a mind - by taking advantage of the
<br>
enormous compression efficiencies enabled by the regularities in our
<br>
Universe; a huge volume of phase space is so regular that it can be summed
<br>
up by the description &quot;dropped glass&quot;, and our minds assume, if they see
<br>
ten glasses drop, that an eleventh glass will drop as well.  That is not a
<br>
proof of future reliability, but rather a historical fact.  Our minds
<br>
assume regularities hold, because, evolutionarily, genes that made that
<br>
assumption - that our Universe possesses an arrow of thermodynamics -
<br>
proved correct every single time in the ancestral environment.  (Almost
<br>
certainly - the whole age of the Earth is not long enough for a single
<br>
thermodynamic anomaly to be expected.)  Again, formally, particular
<br>
incidents in which an organism survived and reproduced again occupied
<br>
compact volumes of phase space; regularities which have become embedded in
<br>
us as expectations.
<br>
<p>Turing's diagonalization theorem can be expressed as follows:  A mind
<br>
cannot perfectly describe itself because there is always, inescapably,
<br>
some part of the mind which at that moment is observing and is not itself
<br>
being observed.  The observer is always smaller than the observed, and
<br>
thus cannot perfectly describe it.
<br>
<p>An AI, presented with Turing's diagonalization trick, would undergo a
<br>
peculiar experience.  Ve simulates and observes an AI which is simulating
<br>
and observing an AI which is simulating and observing an AI, and so on; ve
<br>
can verify that every single AI in the chain is perfectly identical, but
<br>
ve cannot be certain that ve, verself, is identical to the AI it's
<br>
simulating.  Ve can be effectively certain, but this is no help.  Suppose
<br>
that your version of the diagonalization argument is to ask the AI:  &quot;Will
<br>
the AI you're simulating answer 'No' to this question?&quot;  Ve knows that, as
<br>
soon as ve decides to answer &quot;Yes, it will say No&quot; or &quot;No, it will say
<br>
Yes&quot;, through whatever output mechanism has been provided, the AI ve's
<br>
simulating will make the exact same answer, thus invalidating the
<br>
response.  If ve then, on observing the AI, sneakily reconsiders, the AI
<br>
simulated will observe vis own simulation and make exactly the same
<br>
decision.  The simulating AI can never get ahead of the simulated.  If ve
<br>
decides to just let the simulation run indefinitely, then the simulation
<br>
will let its own simulation run indefinitely, and so on, and no answer
<br>
will be returned until the outermost AI gives up and decides to halt the
<br>
simulation - because the underlying causal mechanisms are identical in
<br>
each case.  This is true, but the outermost AI can never be certain of
<br>
this, just as the simulated AI can never be certain that ve is identical
<br>
with vis own simulation.
<br>
<p>A human, of course, can be put to exactly the same torture; we will in
<br>
fact be far worse off, since we'd be totally unable to mentally simulate a
<br>
system of more than a few hundred simplified neurons.  We'd have
<br>
absolutely no clue whether we were looking at a copy of ourselves or not;
<br>
facing a system of that size, we'd roll over and die of sheer boredom. 
<br>
And of course an AI, even one totally immune to boredom, would suffer a
<br>
million-to-one slowdown of the simulated AI if ve attempted to pay any
<br>
sort of conscious attention to individual bits moving around in the
<br>
simulation.  So much for the argument from Godel.
<br>
<p>In this limited sense, then, &quot;perfect sanity&quot; may be impossible, just as
<br>
it is impossible to attain perfect knowledge that glasses do not unsmash
<br>
themselves.  The assumption that glasses do not unsmash themselves is
<br>
perfectly adequate for a decillion years, however, and - mathematically -
<br>
it is not too much to expect of your average transhuman that ve remain
<br>
sane for a decillion years.  In the long run, the total probability of a
<br>
single error in describing reality can be made arbitrarily low, as long as
<br>
the volume of phase space occupied by the mind describing reality keeps on
<br>
expanding.  In other words, to last longer than a decillion years, you
<br>
just need to have a finer-grained description than &quot;falling glass&quot;,
<br>
capturing some of the more compact regularities in the irregularities -
<br>
some of the more obvious cases where glasses fall upward - and then you're
<br>
good for another centillion.  (Substitute much larger numbers for
<br>
&quot;decillion&quot; and &quot;centillion&quot;, by the way.)  This requires an
<br>
ever-expanding amount of RAM - but nowhere near exponentially expanding;
<br>
more like logarithmically expanding.
<br>
<p>A mind may not be able to describe itself in perfect detail, but it may be
<br>
able to come up with a high-level description of itself, and that
<br>
description can be good for a decillion years.  If the mind keeps
<br>
expanding, the description can be good forever.  And when I say
<br>
&quot;high-level&quot;, I mean a description that can be pretty darn fine-grained by
<br>
our standards.  The equivalent would be a human mind describing itself in
<br>
terms of the action of minicolumns; because this description does not take
<br>
individual neurons into account, there is room enough in the neurons to
<br>
store a complete description of the minicolums.  By doing so, of course,
<br>
you are making individual neurons significant and thus ruining the perfect
<br>
usefulness of the minicolumn-level description - the standard Turing
<br>
trap.  In computable systems, there will always be that little leftover
<br>
tail that makes perfect self-observation impossible.  But this doesn't
<br>
need to rule out effectively perfect self-observation - or effectively
<br>
perfect sanity.
<br>
<p>Now, someone could still argue that even &quot;effective perfection&quot; is
<br>
unattainable - that a transhuman will, of necessity, make factual errors
<br>
or insane-class mistakes at least once a month - but if so, it will have
<br>
to be an argument on grounds of cognitive science, rather than mathematics
<br>
or computer science.
