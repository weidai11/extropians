<br>
<p>First of all, you certainly have not shut the door to a mathematical proof
<br>
of transhuman
<br>
minds' significant imperfection.  The analogy to thermodynamics is OK, but
<br>
it doesn't give you
<br>
guidance as to what the actual probabilities involved are.  You just pull
<br>
the probability values
<br>
out of a hat (leading to your figures of decillion years, centillion years,
<br>
etc.), by analogy to
<br>
the logic of much simpler systems.  The door is open for a real mathematical
<br>
analysis of
<br>
the lossiness and error-prone-ness of knowledge and inference in minds of
<br>
various sizes.  However,
<br>
I do not intend to provide this at the moment -- though I do hope, before I
<br>
die (if I ever do, which
<br>
I hope I don't ;), to create a real mathematical theory of mind that would
<br>
allow such questions
<br>
be be explored...
<br>
<p>Second, your investigation raises an interesting question.  If a human were
<br>
faced with the tasks of a
<br>
leaf-cutter ant -- find some leaves to eat, carry them back home and store
<br>
them, then eat them when hungry --
<br>
then presumably the human would not make very many errors of fact or
<br>
judgment.  (If the human went insane
<br>
it would be from boredom ;)
<br>
<p>The point is: We have sought out tasks that strain our cognitive
<br>
architecture.
<br>
<p>What tasks strain us most?  Science and mathematics are two candidates.
<br>
Another candidate is social
<br>
interaction.  Many primate anthropologists believe that the impetus for the
<br>
origin of our big brains
<br>
was the need to socially model each other (lying, cheating, thieving and all
<br>
the good stuff ...)
<br>
<p>Similarly, for our posited superduperbrilliant transhuman minds, there will
<br>
be some tasks that will
<br>
strain even ~their~ intelligence.  Perhaps including the tasks of
<br>
outsmarting one another, or perhaps not --
<br>
I won't pretend to foresee the nature of transhuman social networks or
<br>
whatever replaces social networks
<br>
in such groupings of minds...
<br>
<p>When dealing with tasks that push the limits of the mind, error-prone-ness
<br>
will increase.  I fuck up a lot
<br>
more when proving theorems or making business deals than I would when
<br>
gathering leaves to eat, for example.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, perhaps transhumans won't push the limits of their
<br>
minds... so they'll never have this
<br>
problem, unlike humans.  I can't give a precise refutation of this.  I just
<br>
have an intuition that for any
<br>
intelligent system, a certain percentage of the population will get bored if
<br>
it's not pushing itself to its
<br>
limit.  Maybe this is an anthropmorphization.
<br>
<p>Or is there an uncertainty principle here?  You go nuts from boredom on the
<br>
one hand, or you push yourself
<br>
to the limit and make mistakes on the other hand?
<br>
<p>[Or, better yet, if you're really advanced, you can do
<br>
both at once -- just atke a job in the software business!!  ;p ]
<br>
<p>I don't claim to have demonstrated anything here -- except that there is a
<br>
lot of room for doubt where these
<br>
matters are concerned... that the apparent solidity of arguments based on
<br>
the thermodynamic analogy is only
<br>
apparent.  You may well be right Eliezer, but by ignoring &quot;cognitive
<br>
science&quot; issues you really ignore the
<br>
crux of it all.  Of course our knowledge of transhuman psychology is fairly
<br>
limited, which just means, to my
<br>
mind, that a lot of humility is appropriate in the face of these huge
<br>
questions.
<br>
<p>With a project like building a thinking machine, or proving a theorem, or
<br>
even composing a piece of music,
<br>
one's ideas can eventually be refuted by experience.  The algorithm fails,
<br>
the proof fails, the composition
<br>
sounds bad [to oneself, or to others].  In noodling about transhuman
<br>
psychology, there's no feedback from
<br>
external physical or social or mathemtaical reality, so anything goes --
<br>
until 500 years from now when AI's
<br>
look back and laugh at our silly ideas...

<em> &gt; No description of the physical world that is less complex than the entire
</em><br>
<em> &gt; world can be perfect.  If you drop a glass, it will fall... unless all the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; air molecules underneath it happen to simultaneously move upward and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; strike the glass, while all the air molecules above it happen to be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; elsewhere for a few moments - in which case the glass might hover in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; air, or move upwards instead.  It can happen.  The classical laws of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; physics are CPT invariant; if you play a movie backward, everything that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; happens in it will still conserve mass-energy, momentum, and Newton's laws
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of gravitation.  A shattered glass could leap off the ground, onto the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; table, and reassemble itself, if the molecules happened to be position
</em><br>
<em> &gt; exactly the right way.  This is so enormously improbable, however - and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; far beyond our present art to achieve artificially - that we are forced to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; assume that we are watching a movie being played backward, and not a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; genuine recording of an event, because while the event is physically
</em><br>
<em> &gt; possible, it would be expected to take vastly longer than the age of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Universe for anyone to capture it on film.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The statement that glasses fall down, rather than up, is effectively
</em><br>
<em> &gt; perfect.  &quot;Effectively perfect&quot; statements do not hold in all times and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; all places.  If you live forever... not billions of years, or trillions of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; years, but *forever*... you will eventually see it happen, not just once,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; but many times.  The statement &quot;glasses fall down&quot; will, eventually, fall
</em><br>
<em> &gt; down itself.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The Turing diagonalization argument proves that absolute self-knowledge is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; impossible, at least for computable processes.  Nonetheless, if a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; transhuman can have &quot;effectively perfect&quot; self-knowledge or effectively
</em><br>
<em> &gt; perfect sanity, they will - in all probability - run into no problems for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the first few decillion years... and as long as the amount of RAM keeps
</em><br>
<em> &gt; increasing, they need fear nothing, indefinitely.  (The probability of a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; nonrecoverable error occurring, integrated over infinite time, can be made
</em><br>
<em> &gt; arbitrarily small.)  This follows from the mathematics of effective
</em><br>
<em> &gt; perfection, or &quot;fuzzy phase space theory&quot;.  First, an introduction to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; classical phase spaces.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- Begin expository lump:  Hot metal phase space --
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The first law of thermodynamics states that &quot;You can't win&quot;; you cannot
</em><br>
<em> &gt; decrease the amount of entropy in the Universe.  This follows from a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; theorem which states that, under the classical laws of physics, the volume
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of any phase space is preserved as the system evolves.  The Hamiltonian of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a three-dimensional Newtonian system is a hugely multi-dimensional space,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; which has six dimensions per particle; thus, a Newtonian Universe with
</em><br>
<em> &gt; only 10 particles has a Hamiltonian with sixty dimensions.  Each x, y, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; z dimension describing the (a) particle position and (b) particle
</em><br>
<em> &gt; velocity, for each individual particle, is a separate dimension of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hamiltonian.  Every possible state of this Newtonian Universe, any
</em><br>
<em> &gt; possible combination of positions and velocities for the 20 particles in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it, is a single point within the Hamiltonian.  The evolution of the entire
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Newtonian Universe, particles attracting and repelling each other, causes
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the positions and velocities to change; the point moves around in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hamiltonian.  If the positions and velocities are continuous, which is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; always true of a Newtonian Universe, then the point will follow a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; continuous path within the Hamiltonian as the Newtonian Universe evolves.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The theorem responsible for the first law of thermodynamics says that,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; under certain laws of physics (including our classical laws), the volume
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of a phase space is constant.  If you take eighty hypercubic centimeters
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of phase space and evolve each point in that volume for N minutes, you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; will have eighty hypercubic centimeters at the end of it.  The volume may
</em><br>
<em> &gt; start out as a very compact shape, say a sphere, and wind up spread all
</em><br>
<em> &gt; over the place with all kinds of hyperdimensional wrinkles, but the volume
</em><br>
<em> &gt; will still be eighty hypercubic centimeters.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hence, the first law of thermodynamics.  A high-entropy system occupies a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; large volume of phase space.  A hot piece of metal occupies a larger
</em><br>
<em> &gt; volume of phase space than a cold piece of metal, since the range of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; possible velocities for a particle is larger.  A physical process which
</em><br>
<em> &gt; turned a hot piece of metal into a cold piece of metal plus electricity -
</em><br>
<em> &gt; leaving the rest of the Universe constant - would be a process that turned
</em><br>
<em> &gt; a large area of phase space into a small area, violating the theorem.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Actually, in fact, each individual piece of hot metal or cold metal
</em><br>
<em> &gt; occupies exactly one point within phase space; however, the *class* of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; pieces of hot metal occupies a much larger volume of phase space then the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; *class* of pieces of cold metal.  Thus, a process that turns hot metal *in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; general* into cold metal *in general* is impossible under classical
</em><br>
<em> &gt; physics; an individual piece of hot metal could conceivable turn into cold
</em><br>
<em> &gt; metal plus electricity.  It is simply enormously *improbable* that any
</em><br>
<em> &gt; given piece of hot metal will turn out to occupy one of the vanishingly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rare sub-volumes of &quot;hot metal phase space&quot; which will evolve into &quot;cold
</em><br>
<em> &gt; metal phase space&quot; after some known amount of time (say, five minutes).
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In fact, the phase space volume of &quot;a piece of cold metal heated by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; electricity&quot; will evolve into an equally small sub-volume of &quot;hot metal
</em><br>
<em> &gt; phase space&quot;.  But it isn't a compact sub-volume - not one that's easy to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; describe by any method known to humanity - so we treat this information as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; being lost, and say that the cold metal has now entered &quot;hot metal phase
</em><br>
<em> &gt; space&quot; in general.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The three types of perpetual motion machine which violate the first law
</em><br>
<em> &gt; all take advantage of loopholes in the theorem with respect to our actual,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; nonclassical laws of physics.  (As far as I know, all three types are my
</em><br>
<em> &gt; own invention, or reinvention.)
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The first type of perpetual motion machine, the negative-energy method,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; says that you can manufacture X amount of negative matter, X amount of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; positive matter, pour all your waste heat into the newly created matter,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and then annihilate it, getting rid of the waste heat.  Each time a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; negative particle and a positive particle come into existence, it changes
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the total volume of the Hamiltonian phase space - by adding entire
</em><br>
<em> &gt; dimensions, in fact.  When you annihilate the particles, the total volume
</em><br>
<em> &gt; shrinks again.  In effect, the Type One perpetual motion machine increases
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the total volume of the Universe's Hamiltonian, which means that you can
</em><br>
<em> &gt; choose to wind up in a smaller area (relatively speaking) of that larger
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hamiltonian.  Then you shrink the Hamiltonian back down again by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; annihilating the matter, but you do so in a way which means that you end
</em><br>
<em> &gt; up in a smaller area of your own Hamiltonian.  In other words, when you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; increase the size of the Hamiltonian, you perform a one-to-one
</em><br>
<em> &gt; transformation of your phase space into that Hamiltonian; then, when the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Hamiltonian shrinks, you perform a many-to-one transformation; taken as a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; complete operation, this shrinks the size of your phase space.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The second type of perpetual motion machine, the quantum, notes that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; state-vector reduction again reduces the volume of phase space.  A large
</em><br>
<em> &gt; volume of phase space, describing the probability amplitude that an
</em><br>
<em> &gt; electron is present at all points of space, collapses into a single point
</em><br>
<em> &gt; which describes the electron as being present at a single point in space.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; State-vector reduction takes zillions of possible superposed Universes and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; annihilates all but one of them.  Thus, it may be possible to build a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; quantum perpetual motion machine in which the amplitudes &quot;cold states&quot;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; tend to add up while the amplitudes of &quot;hot states&quot; cancel out;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; effectively, this dumps waste heat into a superposed state that gets
</em><br>
<em> &gt; blipped out of existence when the quantum collapse occurs.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; The third type of perpetual motion machine, the temporal, says that you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; can violate the first law using a time machine.  If you take a heat bath
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and watch it evolving through states for a sufficiently long time, you can
</em><br>
<em> &gt; decide to stop watching at a point where all the atoms on one side happen
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to be moving in the same direction.  The volume of phase space has been
</em><br>
<em> &gt; preserved at all points within the temporal loop, but from the perspective
</em><br>
<em> &gt; of the rest of the Universe, the heat bath rejoins our world only when it
</em><br>
<em> &gt; occupies a particular volume of phase space.  Pieces of a sufficiently
</em><br>
<em> &gt; large physical system will show temporary decreases in entropy due to the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; operation of normal, random mechanisms; a time machine lets you take all
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the temporary decreases, unsynchronize them temporally, and resynchronize
</em><br>
<em> &gt; them so that they all add together.  In other words, the phase space
</em><br>
<em> &gt; remains constant if you evolve *all* of it for N minutes, but if you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; evolve some of it for N minutes and some of it for M minutes, the new
</em><br>
<em> &gt; volumes may overlap; the total volume may not be constant.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; -- End expository lump:  Hot metal phase space --
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In saying that a dropped glass will fall downwards, we are making a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; statement that one volume of phase space - the phase space of dropped
</em><br>
<em> &gt; glasses - will evolve into another phase space; the phase space of glasses
</em><br>
<em> &gt; lying on the floor.  Both volumes of phase space are extremely large, but
</em><br>
<em> &gt; they are relatively compact, and a point in the core volume of the first
</em><br>
<em> &gt; phase space ends up in the core volume of the second phase space, *most of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the time* - they are fuzzy, but not very fuzzy.  The phase spaces are
</em><br>
<em> &gt; compact and their evolution is compact, but will never be perfectly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; compact in an inperfect Universe.  Watch long enough, and you'll see
</em><br>
<em> &gt; glasses falling upwards.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; This phenomenon is what people refer to when they say that perfectly
</em><br>
<em> &gt; rational thought is impossible.  Rational thought is the ability to model,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; predict, and manipulate the regularities in physical reality.  Formally,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this is an attempt to describe a huge amount of information - the Universe
</em><br>
<em> &gt; - with a small amount of information - a mind - by taking advantage of the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; enormous compression efficiencies enabled by the regularities in our
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Universe; a huge volume of phase space is so regular that it can be summed
</em><br>
<em> &gt; up by the description &quot;dropped glass&quot;, and our minds assume, if they see
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ten glasses drop, that an eleventh glass will drop as well.  That is not a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; proof of future reliability, but rather a historical fact.  Our minds
</em><br>
<em> &gt; assume regularities hold, because, evolutionarily, genes that made that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; assumption - that our Universe possesses an arrow of thermodynamics -
</em><br>
<em> &gt; proved correct every single time in the ancestral environment.  (Almost
</em><br>
<em> &gt; certainly - the whole age of the Earth is not long enough for a single
</em><br>
<em> &gt; thermodynamic anomaly to be expected.)  Again, formally, particular
</em><br>
<em> &gt; incidents in which an organism survived and reproduced again occupied
</em><br>
<em> &gt; compact volumes of phase space; regularities which have become embedded in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; us as expectations.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Turing's diagonalization theorem can be expressed as follows:  A mind
</em><br>
<em> &gt; cannot perfectly describe itself because there is always, inescapably,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; some part of the mind which at that moment is observing and is not itself
</em><br>
<em> &gt; being observed.  The observer is always smaller than the observed, and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; thus cannot perfectly describe it.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; An AI, presented with Turing's diagonalization trick, would undergo a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; peculiar experience.  Ve simulates and observes an AI which is simulating
</em><br>
<em> &gt; and observing an AI which is simulating and observing an AI, and so on; ve
</em><br>
<em> &gt; can verify that every single AI in the chain is perfectly identical, but
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ve cannot be certain that ve, verself, is identical to the AI it's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; simulating.  Ve can be effectively certain, but this is no help.  Suppose
</em><br>
<em> &gt; that your version of the diagonalization argument is to ask the AI:  &quot;Will
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the AI you're simulating answer 'No' to this question?&quot;  Ve knows that, as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; soon as ve decides to answer &quot;Yes, it will say No&quot; or &quot;No, it will say
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Yes&quot;, through whatever output mechanism has been provided, the AI ve's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; simulating will make the exact same answer, thus invalidating the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; response.  If ve then, on observing the AI, sneakily reconsiders, the AI
</em><br>
<em> &gt; simulated will observe vis own simulation and make exactly the same
</em><br>
<em> &gt; decision.  The simulating AI can never get ahead of the simulated.  If ve
</em><br>
<em> &gt; decides to just let the simulation run indefinitely, then the simulation
</em><br>
<em> &gt; will let its own simulation run indefinitely, and so on, and no answer
</em><br>
<em> &gt; will be returned until the outermost AI gives up and decides to halt the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; simulation - because the underlying causal mechanisms are identical in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; each case.  This is true, but the outermost AI can never be certain of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; this, just as the simulated AI can never be certain that ve is identical
</em><br>
<em> &gt; with vis own simulation.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; A human, of course, can be put to exactly the same torture; we will in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; fact be far worse off, since we'd be totally unable to mentally simulate a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; system of more than a few hundred simplified neurons.  We'd have
</em><br>
<em> &gt; absolutely no clue whether we were looking at a copy of ourselves or not;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; facing a system of that size, we'd roll over and die of sheer boredom.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; And of course an AI, even one totally immune to boredom, would suffer a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; million-to-one slowdown of the simulated AI if ve attempted to pay any
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sort of conscious attention to individual bits moving around in the
</em><br>
<em> &gt; simulation.  So much for the argument from Godel.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; In this limited sense, then, &quot;perfect sanity&quot; may be impossible, just as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it is impossible to attain perfect knowledge that glasses do not unsmash
</em><br>
<em> &gt; themselves.  The assumption that glasses do not unsmash themselves is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; perfectly adequate for a decillion years, however, and - mathematically -
</em><br>
<em> &gt; it is not too much to expect of your average transhuman that ve remain
</em><br>
<em> &gt; sane for a decillion years.  In the long run, the total probability of a
</em><br>
<em> &gt; single error in describing reality can be made arbitrarily low, as long as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the volume of phase space occupied by the mind describing reality keeps on
</em><br>
<em> &gt; expanding.  In other words, to last longer than a decillion years, you
</em><br>
<em> &gt; just need to have a finer-grained description than &quot;falling glass&quot;,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; capturing some of the more compact regularities in the irregularities -
</em><br>
<em> &gt; some of the more obvious cases where glasses fall upward - and then you're
</em><br>
<em> &gt; good for another centillion.  (Substitute much larger numbers for
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;decillion&quot; and &quot;centillion&quot;, by the way.)  This requires an
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ever-expanding amount of RAM - but nowhere near exponentially expanding;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; more like logarithmically expanding.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; A mind may not be able to describe itself in perfect detail, but it may be
</em><br>
<em> &gt; able to come up with a high-level description of itself, and that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; description can be good for a decillion years.  If the mind keeps
</em><br>
<em> &gt; expanding, the description can be good forever.  And when I say
</em><br>
<em> &gt; &quot;high-level&quot;, I mean a description that can be pretty darn fine-grained by
</em><br>
<em> &gt; our standards.  The equivalent would be a human mind describing itself in
</em><br>
<em> &gt; terms of the action of minicolumns; because this description does not take
</em><br>
<em> &gt; individual neurons into account, there is room enough in the neurons to
</em><br>
<em> &gt; store a complete description of the minicolums.  By doing so, of course,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; you are making individual neurons significant and thus ruining the perfect
</em><br>
<em> &gt; usefulness of the minicolumn-level description - the standard Turing
</em><br>
<em> &gt; trap.  In computable systems, there will always be that little leftover
</em><br>
<em> &gt; tail that makes perfect self-observation impossible.  But this doesn't
</em><br>
<em> &gt; need to rule out effectively perfect self-observation - or effectively
</em><br>
<em> &gt; perfect sanity.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Now, someone could still argue that even &quot;effective perfection&quot; is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; unattainable - that a transhuman will, of necessity, make factual errors
</em><br>
<em> &gt; or insane-class mistakes at least once a month - but if so, it will have
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to be an argument on grounds of cognitive science, rather than mathematics
</em><br>
<em> &gt; or computer science.
