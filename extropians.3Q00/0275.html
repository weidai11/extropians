<P>
<EM>&gt;Do I have to spell it out for you again. lets go. The people are not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interested of geeky religions and math teorems, end of story.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If they have alredy formd a predjudice against transhumanism becuse Tippler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we are all very FUCKED. Then we're seen as a nutty sect, and in for all heck
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of a lot of slope before being able to communicate outwards again. And this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just because they skimmed a Tipler page or especially anti- Tipler page.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, what to do?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ingdahl
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the more we worry about (and/or become defensive about) prejudices we
<BR>
imagine the general public to have against transhumanism, the more fanatic we
<BR>
tend to make transhumanists look. After all, one of the things that
<BR>
characterizes religious fanaticism relates to its zealous and desperate desire
<BR>
to convert everyone to its way of thinking (due in large measure to the doubt
<BR>
that reason injects into dogma). Let's have the confidence that scientific
<BR>
competence allows us. To paraphrase Galileo, we can alter what we have written
<BR>
about it, but we can't diminish the real probity of extropy. Don't fret,
<BR>
extrope.
