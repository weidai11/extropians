I was looking up references to this Herpes vaccine you were talking about, 
<BR>
and I ran into this:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.dfwdoctors.com/utsw/herpes.htm">http://www.dfwdoctors.com/utsw/herpes.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Can you IMAGINE participating in this study, and receiving the placebo? 
<BR>
You'd instantly get an incurable disease for your trouble.
<BR>
Yikes.

<EM>&gt;any male who asserts that a female is less a person for desiring sex is

<EM>&gt;propagating a meme that is counter to his desire for a large population of

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Edinburgh University scientists say the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; clinical trials of a male contraceptive pill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest it is 100% effective, with no harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; consequences. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;But after discussing the idea of a male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pill with lots of different women, I discovered that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the (then) prevalent attitude was that it didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;matter if there was a male pill because men could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;really be trusted to take it.  I heard things like,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;&quot;Well, if I was living with the guy and I actually saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;him take it then I guess it would be OK, but if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;just dating some guy, I'm not going to take the chance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of getting pregnant on his say-so that he took the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pill.  I'd have to take my own precautions to be on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the safe side anyway.&quot;  The article says only 2%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;wouldn't trust their partner to take the new pill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Where do you live?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I have heard this a lot since moving to Utah and I thought it was derived 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the marriage-oriented culture here. But it seems to be the general 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;assumption that men would not bother to take the 30 seconds per day which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it takes to take a pill, because they secretly want to get women pregnant 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so they can get married and have a family. This is really, really 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;counterintuitive. Most women I know want to have children one day, many of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them soon - do most men want to have children?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;One concern that a friend of mine expressed is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;those men least likely to take the male pill are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;ignorant, the stupid, and the lazy while those most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;likely to take the pill are on the other end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;spectrum.  Not particularly good news for the gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pool.  This friend of mine also suggested that men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;will now have even more of a propinquity to engage in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;meaningless sexual encounters and women's psyches will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;continue to harbor resentment toward themselves, men,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;and society in general because of this behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Who was it here who suggested a genetic engineering solution by which 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people are born (or made to be, through gene therapy), infertile, and then 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have to take a fertility pill to replentish whatever chemical their bodies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been made unable to produce in order to have children. This is an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;excellent idea, and I hope a gene therapy solution will soon be in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;works. I have another idea which may or may not be workable, I dont know - 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but a vasectomy which, rather then simply severing the tube and letting 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the ends heal, puts a &quot;switch&quot; between both ends - some kind of pump, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;better yet, a tube which can switch from open to contracted states 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;chemically. By a remote control, or by taking a pill (one time), you turn 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the switch to open or closed to let sperm pass through, depending on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether you want children or not. Problem: people are still fertile up to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a month after a vasectomy from sperm leftover in the tubes and I'd expect 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this to be an issue here too. I think this would be a small problem, as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people would not be changing their minds once a week about having children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I pondered the idea of learning how to do this myself and building my own 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;- knowing how I am with building things, I would end up with a foot-long 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;length of rubber hose extending from my scrotum.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Sometimes it seems like this notion that recreational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;sex is a bad thing is primarily propagated by those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;women who continue to perceive the need for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;long-term commitment from a man before they can feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;comfortable in a relationship and this appears to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;carryover from the days when women depended heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;upon men's resources for their well-being and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;well-being of their children.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That's certainly half of it...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The other half comes from men - guys who will lose respect for a woman and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think of her as a &quot;slut&quot; after she sleeps with him. I think this is less 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common today, but certainly in the past (from what I have read and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;observed of some old people), the idea is that a good woman, the kind who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you marry, is one who doesn't really like sex too much but will &quot;let you&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do it to her, as a matrimonial duty. These are the kind for having 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;children with. The other kind is the kind for having enjoyable sex with, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and are often prostitutes. This attitude is expressed very well by a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;character in &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; if you've seen it (a pretty bad movie, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;actually). You would also be familiar with it if you know anyone in a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frat. If you ever see a book called &quot;Deviant behavior&quot; (sociology book) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look up the number of men who have lost their virginity to prostitutes 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today, compared to thoe who did in the 1940s - I don't remember the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;statistic but it's the opposite of what you would think.. severalfold 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;higher in the 40s. Also, often people who are arrested for prostitution 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(some cities publish this data in papers) are very conservative, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;traditional types of men.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;My hope is that the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;pill will indeed take us a step closer toward a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;relaxed attitude toward our sexuality, but not a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;relaxed attitude toward the responsibilities of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;marriage and/or family. We really need to get past the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;paradigm where women sort men by the size of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;wallets and men sort women by their potential for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;sexual gratification. I have to admit though, these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;hopes are probably unrealistic on my part.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Also required are cures for various STDs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ideally: full cures and vaccines for HIV, herpes, and HPV, (are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cures/vaccines for the latter two being worked on anyplace?) as well as a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wider testing for bacterial STDs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;What are some of the other Male Pill issues being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;debated?
