Dear Extropes,
<BR>
<P>This is a long email (partial result of thinking about this topic for
<BR>
some other work) regarding carbon in comets and dust the solar system.
<BR>
<P>And I thought to write the long message to the list, so that other
<BR>
people can see and contribute. 
<BR>
<P>Robert wrote me a while ago asking me about the composition of
<BR>
solar system dust, in particular, if we see C-compounds in greater
<BR>
abundance than O-compounds. He pointed to the abundance of water in
<BR>
comets, which seemed peculiar to him because he would expect from
<BR>
normal stellar synthesis that the amount of C should be &gt;&gt; amount of
<BR>
O, so the most abundant compound *should* be CH4, not H2O. And
<BR>
since, in the sun it seems C ~= O, one could argue that CH4
<BR>
abundance should be ~= to H2O. Then, when we spoke in email again,
<BR>
Robert said that he thinks that he understands the discrepancy:
<BR>
&quot;which seems to be due to the H &amp; O binding to the C, forming CH4 &amp;
<BR>
CO and it getting blown out of the system due to their low freezing
<BR>
points.  It may get accumulated in the Oort cloud comets, but then
<BR>
it is likely to blow off on their first past by the sun (on my todo
<BR>
list is to look at some cometary tail spectra and molecule
<BR>
abundances).&quot;
<BR>
<P>So his questions to me are:
<BR>
<P>&quot;a) Does the carbon show up in the interstellar dust in some way?&quot;
<BR>
<P>(This ^^ question answered after &quot;b&quot;)
<BR>
<P>&quot;b) Why does oxygen seem to be in excess relative to the carbon?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the question is, is it a galactic situation or a local
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;phonomena?&quot;
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
Answering b.
<BR>
<P>I don't know the answer to b.  But here are some pointers.
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Duley, (1984), Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society,
<BR>
Vol 25, 109, shows a table of the depletion of elements in
<BR>
interstellar space, that might be useful ...  I think that it is
<BR>
generally assumed that the depleted carbon is in the form of CO or
<BR>
other carbon-bearing molecules such as PAHs.
<BR>
<P>My old post on carbon in the grand scheme:

<BR>
<P>I told last fall about an important interdisciplinary paper about dust
<BR>
embedded in the interstellar cloud flowing through the solar system.

<BR>
<P>Read this paper once. Then read it again. Then go find a professional
<BR>
astronomer specializing in the interstellar medium and ask him/her
<BR>
your questions. I've read this paper 3 times all of the way through,
<BR>
and I don't understand all of the pieces yet. (Why have a B star as a
<BR>
reference star for the abundances... what does this mean about
<BR>
interstellar Kr? Why place so much weight on a MRN distribution for
<BR>
interstellar dust?)
<BR>
<P>Frisch et al's paper does and concludes:
<BR>
<P>* Elemental abundances and the dust-to-gas ratio are calculated towards
<BR>
two directions (&quot;column densities&quot;) in our local interstellar
<BR>
environment: towards eps CMa and alpha Sco.
<BR>
<P>* There is not enough mass &quot;missing&quot; from the gas phase to form the dust
<BR>
grain population observed by the spacecraft.
<BR>
<P>* Dust grains are overabundant in the cloud feeding interstellar
<BR>
grains into the solar system.
<BR>
<P>* The cloud around the solar system is a weakly depleted cloud with
<BR>
respect to the refractory elements.
<BR>
<P>* There is evidence for interstellar shock fronts destroying grains in
<BR>
the local interstellar cloud (LIC).
<BR>
<P>* The eps CMA LIC component has no carbon available for the dust, a
<BR>
manifestation of the &quot;carbon crisis&quot; written in Dwek (1997). The lack
<BR>
of carbon avail for the interstellar dust grains and the presence of
<BR>
SiC presolar grains in meteorites may indicate an additional
<BR>
carbon-rich grain source beyond gas condensation from circumstellar
<BR>
dust grains.

<BR>
Answering a.
<BR>
<P>Here, I point to some references that could be helpful.
<BR>
<P>Then I attach an essay I wrote ~1 week ago, while thinking
<BR>
of this topic.
<BR>
--------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P><P>COMETS
<BR>
<P>My (admittedly vague) answer to Robert's question is that I don't
<BR>
think that comets display chemical abundances, including carbon,
<BR>
that are far from solar abundances. Most references I've skimmed
<BR>
don't see any problem with carbon abundances. One needs to look at
<BR>
the gas phase elements versus the solid phase elements, too, of
<BR>
course.
<BR>
<P>A detailed reference for chemical abundances in the solar nebula is
<BR>
Chapter 4: &quot;The Sun and Solar Nebula&quot; in _Physics and Chemistry of
<BR>
the Solar System_ by John Lewis.
<BR>
<P>I saw several very helpful chapters to answer some of these
<BR>
questions in:
<BR>
<P>_Comets in the Post Halley Era_, Vol 1&amp;2, R.L. Newburn, Jr. M.
<BR>
Neugebauer, J. Rahe, editors, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991.
<BR>
<P>Hans Rickman's chapter: &quot;The Thermal History and Structure of
<BR>
Cometary Nuclei&quot; shows a Figure 1,  that H2O ice condensed in the
<BR>
crystalline state at about 150K, and more volatile species (CO or
<BR>
CO2) were depleted at slightly higher temperatures (confirming what
<BR>
you said). More figures and discussions in this chapter than what I
<BR>
have time to look at.., but it probably confirms everything that you
<BR>
wrote.
<BR>
<P>Bertram Donn's chapter: &quot;The Accumulation and Structure of Comets&quot;
<BR>
say that: &quot;inthe case of comets, temperatures had to be sufficiently
<BR>
low for the normally volatile components of comets (H2, C2H2, CO,
<BR>
CO2, NH3, HCN) to condense into grains or be adsorbed on or into
<BR>
grains.&quot; Then there is a long discussion of how grains might form.
<BR>
<P>And in this chapter: E.K. Jessberger and J. Kissel, &quot;Chemical
<BR>
Properties of Cometary Dust and a Note on Carbon Isotopes&quot; of the
<BR>
above book, I saw a detailed discussion of elemental abundances of
<BR>
dust in Halley's comet, that points to some interesting observations
<BR>
of carbon isotopic ratios.
<BR>
<P>Some of Jessberger's and Kissel's conclusions:
<BR>
<P>* Halley's dust is composed of two components: a refractory organic
<BR>
phase (CHON) and a Mg-rich silicate phase.
<BR>
<P>* The CHON elements are more abundant than in CI chondrites. The
<BR>
abundances of C and O approach the solar system (==cosmic)
<BR>
abundances, N is intermediate between the solar and CI-chondrite
<BR>
abundances, and H is much closer to the CI-chondrite abunance than
<BR>
to the solar one.
<BR>
<P>* Within a factor of two, the abundances of the rock-forming
<BR>
elements are the same as in the whole solar system (== cosmic).
<BR>
<P>* The variations of elements Mg, Si, and Fe, as well as the
<BR>
enrichment of volatile elements (relative to CI chondrites),
<BR>
provide a link between Halley's dust and interplanetary dust
<BR>
particles, especially the anhydrous variety.
<BR>
<P>* On the isotopic compositions: in general no element showed
<BR>
deviations from the normal solar system composition with the only
<BR>
exception being carbon, in which the measured 12/13 intensity ratios
<BR>
range from about 1 to 5000. No simple explanation for that can be
<BR>
given. The graphite in the Murchison carbonaceous chondrite with
<BR>
12C/13C was also showed about 5000, which is produced in He-burning
<BR>
or explosive H-burning processes, so these isotopic anonmalies in
<BR>
Halley's comet dust probably reveal nucleosynthetic processes.
<BR>
<P>There's alot more information for you than what I've mentioned about
<BR>
this topic in this two-volume book series, that would be useful for
<BR>
you, so I suggest taking a look.
<BR>
<P>Another more detailed comet dust chemistry reference for you (I'm
<BR>
weak in chemistry, sorry) is the chapter: &quot;Organic Chemistry in
<BR>
Comets from Remote and In-situ Observations&quot; by J. Kissel, F.R.
<BR>
Krueger, and K. Roessler in _Comets and the Origin and Evolution of
<BR>
Life_ by Springer Verlag, 1997. I don't have time to read this but I
<BR>
can tell you that you will find 40 pages of detailed organic
<BR>
chemistry discussions for the comet dust.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;(on my todo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list is to look at some cometary tail spectra and molecule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abundances).
</EM><BR>
<P>Take a look at:
<BR>
<P>Table 1: &quot;Observed Species in Comet Spectra&quot; of S. Wyckoff's
<BR>
chapter: &quot;Overview of Comet Observations&quot; in _Comets_ by Laurel
<BR>
Wilkening, ed., University of Az Press, 1982 would help you answer
<BR>
this. The table shows about 30 atoms or molecules observed in comet
<BR>
spectra.
<BR>
<P>--------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>INTERPLANETARY DUST
<BR>
<P>No ``loose&quot; dust particles remain from the formation of the solar
<BR>
system. Poynting-Robertson drag influences the lifetime of
<BR>
interplanetary dust particles. Micrometer-sized dust particles
<BR>
spiral into the Sun in only a few tens of thousands of years.
<BR>
Larger, centimeter-sized particles live a little bit longer -- tens
<BR>
of millions of years. To find ``primal dust&quot;, one must look into
<BR>
asteroids, comets and meteoroids.
<BR>
<P>In-situ compositional observations of interplanetary dust is still
<BR>
in its infancy. Comet Halley was probed by PUMA. Now, we have
<BR>
Cassini and Stardust dust instruments, both performing compositional
<BR>
analysis, and the measurements are difficult to interpret, so can't
<BR>
say much yet about that.
<BR>
<P>Typical interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are fine-grained
<BR>
mixtures of thousands to millions of mineral grains and amorphous
<BR>
components. Most of the IDPs can have wide ranging elemental
<BR>
compositions at a given phase in the particle [2].
<BR>
<P>The great majority of interplanetary dust particles fall into the
<BR>
chondritic class. The abundant elements Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Cr, Mn,
<BR>
Fe, and Ni are present within a factor of a few of CI chondritic
<BR>
abundance. Where large deviations from cosmic abundances occur, it
<BR>
is usually in particles dominated by large mineral grains such as
<BR>
sulfides, Mg silicates, FeNi metal, phosphides or carbonates. The
<BR>
presence of large pyroxene, olivine, or other phases commonly cause
<BR>
deviations from chondritic abundances also [1].

<BR>
THE DUSTY TRAIL FROM THE SOLAR NEBULA TO THE EARTH
<BR>
==================================================

<BR>
<P><P><P>What are some of the possible paths for the materials of
<BR>
interplanetary dust particles to arrive at our Earth's doorstep, and
<BR>
what does the compositional analysis of dust particles tell us about
<BR>
dust particles' origin?
<BR>
<P>During our solar system's formation history,  the most abundant
<BR>
element was (and still is) H2. The metallic elements: magnesium,
<BR>
silicon, and iron, which are the principal ingredients of rocky
<BR>
planets, condensed into solids at the highest temperatures. The
<BR>
range of elements of the solar nebula between H2 and (Mg, Si, Fe) is
<BR>
not known well (Wood, J., 1999). Some molecules such as CO, N2, NH3,
<BR>
and free oxygen, existed in a gas phase. Some molecules, for
<BR>
example, graphite (C) and SiC condensed into solid grains.  Some
<BR>
molecules also formed complex organic compounds and some molecules
<BR>
formed frozen ice mantles, of which either could coat the
<BR>
&quot;refractory&quot; (Mg, Si, Fe) grain cores.
<BR>
<P>The formation of these molecules was determined, in large part, by
<BR>
the temperature of the nebula. Since the temperature of the solar
<BR>
nebula decreased with heliocentric distance, scientists can infer a
<BR>
dust grain's origin(s) with knowledge of the grain's materials. Some
<BR>
materials could only have been formed at high temperatures, while
<BR>
other grain materials could only have been formed at much lower
<BR>
temperatures. The materials in a single interplanetary dust particle
<BR>
often show that the grain elements formed in different locations and
<BR>
at different times in the solar nebula.
<BR>
<P>Most of the matter present in the original solar nebula has since
<BR>
disappeared; drawn into the Sun, expelled into interstellar space,
<BR>
or reprocessed, for example, as part of the planets, asteroids or
<BR>
comets.
<BR>
<P>The major sources of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are
<BR>
asteroids and comets (Leinert and Gruen, 1990). Comet dust studies
<BR>
are especially interesting because comets preserve some of the
<BR>
primordial material out of which our solar system formed, and comets
<BR>
are currently the most abundant source of unchanged nebular
<BR>
material. Brownlee stated in 1994 that cometary dust might
<BR>
eventually provide information on matter from: (1) the ancient solar
<BR>
system, (2) the outer solar system and (3) from pre-solar epochs.
<BR>
However, before we can make such a conclusion, we must solve a
<BR>
long-standing question: which interplanetary dust particles are
<BR>
cometary and which are asteroidal? (Jessberger, 2000)
<BR>
<P>At the moment, we don't have *direct* laboratory access to cometary
<BR>
or asteroidal dust material. However, *indirectly*, we do have
<BR>
laboratory access. Some of those dust particles are swept up by the
<BR>
Earth, and collected by research aircraft that fly high in the
<BR>
stratosphere. Other interplanetary dust particles are collected on
<BR>
the large Earth ice-masses (Antartica and Greenland and Arctic) and
<BR>
in deep-sea sediments. These stratospheric and polar ice melt
<BR>
interplanetary dust particles are then examined in the laboratory.
<BR>
<P>The arrows in the following diagram show one possible path from a
<BR>
collected interplanetary dust particle back to the early stages of
<BR>
the solar nebula.

<BR>
<P>Astrophysicists and planetary scientists are especially intrigued by
<BR>
the chondritic IDPs because they provide a link to the astrophysical
<BR>
conditions out of which our solar system formed.
<BR>
<P>We can follow the trail to the right in the diagram above to the
<BR>
IDPs that contain the most volatile and primitive elements. The
<BR>
trail takes us first from interplanetary dust particles to
<BR>
*chondritic* interplanetary dust particles. Planetary scientists
<BR>
classify chondritic IDPs in terms of their diminishing degree of
<BR>
oxidation so that they fall into three major groups: the
<BR>
carbonaneous, the ordinary, and the enstatite chondrites. As the
<BR>
name implies, the carbonaceous condrites are rich in carbon, and
<BR>
many have anomalies in the isotopic abundances of H, C, N, and O
<BR>
(Jessberger, 2000). From the carbonaceous chondrites, we follow the
<BR>
trail to the most primitive materials. They are almost completely
<BR>
oxidized and contain the most low condensation temperature elements
<BR>
(&quot;volatile&quot; elements) and the largest amount of organic compounds
<BR>
(Excell, 1998). Therefore, dust particles with these elements are
<BR>
thought to be formed in the early life of our solar system. Why? The
<BR>
volatile elements have never seen temperatures above about 500 K,
<BR>
therefore, one can conclude that the IDP grain &quot;matrix&quot; consists of
<BR>
some very primitive solar system material. Such a scenario is true
<BR>
in the case of comet dust (Gruen, 1999).
<BR>
<P>We can learn more about these particles' origin, by examining their
<BR>
surfaces. If we examine, in the laboratory,  dust particles' density
<BR>
of solar flare tracks, their amorphous rims, and the spallogenic
<BR>
isotopes from cosmic rays (Flynn, 1996), then we have good clues for
<BR>
how long a particle has been travelling in space. Nuclear damage
<BR>
tracks are caused by the ion flux from solar flares. Solar wind ions
<BR>
impacting on the particle's surface produce amorphous radiation
<BR>
damaged rims on the particle's surface. And spallogenic nuclei are
<BR>
produced by galactic and solar cosmic rays. A dust particle that
<BR>
originates in the Kuiper Belt at 40AU would have many more times the
<BR>
density of tracks, thicker amorphous rims and higher integrated
<BR>
doses than a dust particle originating in the main-asteroid belt.
<BR>
<P>One aspect of IDPs that I find especially interesting is the study
<BR>
of &quot;chondrules&quot;. Chondrules are millimeter-sized spherical &quot;drops&quot;
<BR>
suspended in the younger matrix of dust grain material of chondritic
<BR>
meteorites and chondritic interplanetary dust particles. The term
<BR>
&quot;chondrule&quot; is from the Greek word &quot;chondros&quot;, which means &quot;grain of
<BR>
seed.&quot; The spherical shape is evidence of a gravity-free formation
<BR>
environment. (Excell, S. 1998). Chondrules are leftover chaff from
<BR>
the time period of the collapse of the solar nebula. Chondrules were
<BR>
once molten, which required temperatures in excess of 1500 to 1900 K
<BR>
The chondrules must have cooled very rapidly, in about an hour
<BR>
(Wood, 1999). They could not have been formed in the ambient
<BR>
temperature of the innermost solar nebula, instead, they were formed
<BR>
as the result of a quick, high-energy event, for example, a
<BR>
lightning discharge, an accretion shock, or a magnetic nebular
<BR>
flare.
<BR>
<P>Upon further examination of the dust particle &quot;matrix&quot;, one
<BR>
sometimes finds &quot;Calcium-Aluminum-Inclusions&quot; or CAIs, between the
<BR>
chondrules. CAIs were formed at much higher temperatures than the
<BR>
temperatures at which chondrules formed, and CAIs may have survived
<BR>
many multiple high-temperature events (while most chondrules are the
<BR>
product of a single, transient melting event (Excell, 1998)).
<BR>
<P>Even more interesting for understanding the origin of CAIs: isotopic
<BR>
studies show anomalies of excess amounts of oxygen and magnesium.
<BR>
The large variability in isotopic composition, some factors of 1000
<BR>
times the solar hydrogen isotope ratios (Gruen, 1999), indicate that
<BR>
some grains are &quot;not homogenized&quot; with other solar system material,
<BR>
but have preserved much of their presolar environment. The isotopic
<BR>
anomalies of CAIs give us a good clue about some of the events of
<BR>
our solar system's formation because the isotopic anomalies infer
<BR>
that the solar nebula collapsed shortly after a _nearby supernova
<BR>
event_. In addition, radiactive dating methods show that the
<BR>
formation of CAIs preceded the formation of chondrules by about 2
<BR>
million years (Excell, 1998).
