<EM>&gt;  &gt; We are still a movement that hides in the basement, we' re not getting

<EM>&gt;out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; in the public forums, after so much time. Actually the trend does seem 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; to go backwards. Rereading old issues of Extropy magazine was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interesting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; but frightening, the discourse was on a higher, more informed, level.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe it's just me, but it seems a few years ago the list discussion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*was* at a higher level.
</EM><BR>
<P>And the membership of a least the Swedish Transhumanist Association has been 
<BR>
&quot;around 60 persons&quot; for a bit too long.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; In my last days in the Swedish Transhumanist Association I often found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; myself writing e-mail about 30 or 40K long explaining basically 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Economics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 101&quot; to others, constantly trying to re- invent the wheel to keep the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My hunch is that economics will be eventually reinvented, becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;essentially a formal physical/information theory. There's nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;basic about the economy. Everyone who thinks the field is mature is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imho totally mistaken. Of course, we're not exactly throwing around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;equations and results from numerical models, when discussion markets &amp;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Co. I frankly admit to not knowing what the best system is, hence I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually keep my trap shut when such high-falutin' stuff is being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly, isn't this a dismissal of economics as a scientific discipline? 
<BR>
Isn't it possible to observe how economics work in practice? Aren't there 
<BR>
any basics in economy, can it work in every possible way? Why do some 
<BR>
societies achieve economic success, while others don't? Can we find the 
<BR>
explanation to this? I personally question the too holistic and positivist 
<BR>
view of the presently dominant neo- classical school that is unfortunately 
<BR>
too much scientistic, prefering myself the individualist, praxeological view 
<BR>
of the Austrian school. But neither school would say that the other one is 
<BR>
irrelevant. The results of economics are very important. What economical 
<BR>
system will produce the best economy? What do we mean by the best? Questions 
<BR>
that are indeed very important to a transhumanist! What system will favour 
<BR>
progress and dynamism in society? What will the institutions of the various 
<BR>
systems be like, and will they favour the transhumanist ideology?
<BR>
<P>Knowing and learning about this is very important to a transhumanist, even 
<BR>
if he is involved in natural sciences and technology. That is why myself 
<BR>
have tried, correspondently, to learn as much as I can about computer 
<BR>
science, biology, chemistry etc. If I don't, I wouldn't be a very good 
<BR>
economist at all (as Friedrich A. Hayek would have said).
<BR>
<P>Being silent in the debate isn't a solution either, good theories don't win 
<BR>
the debate by themselves, and making a paraphrase of Pericles (the Athenian 
<BR>
statesman) &quot;just because you do not take interest in economics, doesn't mean 
<BR>
that economics will not take interest in you&quot;.
<BR>
<P>There is of course a political side of this (but there is in all sciences, 
<BR>
even natural sciences, otherwise Gallileo Gallilei would never have had an 
<BR>
unfriendly meeting with the Inquisition, and Stalin wouldn't have been 
<BR>
nominated &quot;the most important scientist of all times&quot; in the Soviet Union). 
<BR>
Which system is practical and moral? And if we don't give people those 
<BR>
answers others will! And I don't think we'll see much possiblities to 
<BR>
develop transhumanism in certain economic systems. And we cannot build an 
<BR>
advanced technological civilisation by ourselves, we need a transhumanist 
<BR>
world, to make full use of the capacity of the economy to obtain our goals. 
<BR>
Then again, which system is best? Are there better ones than the ones we can 
<BR>
observe at present? Are transhumanism's goals even economically attainable?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; My experience says that one of the problems are that the transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; movement established itself, from the beginning, as an activist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;movement.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Activism is important, but it is a later stage in the development of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; political movement. Looking on how other movements established 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Transhumanism is based on science and technology, right?.
</EM><BR>
<P>Partially, it is also (as its forerunner humanism) a moral system (and I 
<BR>
dare say political because of its ideological considerations), isn't it? 
<BR>
Thus it makes a valiant attempt to do something that few philosophical 
<BR>
systems have even tried. Integrating the value of science and technology 
<BR>
into the fields of morality and political theory (the other example I come 
<BR>
to think of on a hunch is marxism) giving it an immense potential.
<BR>
<P>But transhumanism also tries to explain why it is morally good and practical 
<BR>
to use technologies, to develop oneself, to learn more, to be tolerant about 
<BR>
others choices (&quot;long live all wetware, ban all hardware?&quot;) etc.
<BR>
In themselves nanotechnology, genetics or AI computer programs are not 
<BR>
transhumanist technologies. They could just as well be used by, for 
<BR>
instance, a fascist ideology. What makes them specifically transhumanist is 
<BR>
the ideas of how these technologies ought to be taken into practice.
<BR>
<P>Frankly, I think that the fields of metaphysics and ontology (epistemology) 
<BR>
are relevant to transhumanism too, in order to reach values in morality and 
<BR>
political theory. But here perhaps we have more help by the approach of 
<BR>
science, based on aristotelianism (with modifications indeed, but that is 
<BR>
another discussion). But if we base ourselves on the &quot;scientific&quot; 
<BR>
(&quot;aristotelian&quot;) views in metaphysics and ontology it will generate certain 
<BR>
values in morality and political theory too, in order to avoid philosophical 
<BR>
discrepancies (once again there could be multiple answers here, but we could 
<BR>
at least see what answers wouldn't be possible).
<BR>
<P>This makes transhumanism a much deeper philosophy, that will instill more 
<BR>
ethusiasm in people (and even make them live as transhumanists), instead of 
<BR>
a bland technocratic view (&quot;what are we going to use all that technology 
<BR>
for, and why is it good?&quot;)
<BR>
<P>This is the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;true cutting edge, and there all the work is being done. Everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else is, well, words and memes.
</EM><BR>
<P>But those words and memes will influence very much if that science and 
<BR>
technology will ever develop. And please do not forget that it is called 
<BR>
transHUMANISM. Man is a very important part of this, since it is humans that 
<BR>
will use and value these facts or technologies. This is the part of 
<BR>
humanities and social sciences, to explain what human society is and even 
<BR>
what it could be like (I am not being positivist here, rather taking a more 
<BR>
Popperian approach).
<BR>
<P>But without these disciplines we cannot understand ourselves as individuals 
<BR>
or as societies. And how can we develop technologies for people that we 
<BR>
don't understand? And of course, if these disciplines show that 
<BR>
&quot;transhumanist technologies&quot; will have a negative impact on society (mind 
<BR>
you, a too big part of the present discourse in these disciplines are saying 
<BR>
just this), people will choose other values. &quot;Virtual reality alienates 
<BR>
people to one another and brings about the collapse of true intrapersonal 
<BR>
contact, would you like to be alienated&quot;? Nope. There a transhumanist view 
<BR>
can show that this wouldn't have to be the case at all, rather it could be 
<BR>
used to enrich intrapersonal contacts. A society that finds, for instance, 
<BR>
genetics, immoral and unpractical wont develop it.
<BR>
<P>And if we don't understand what transhumanist ideas are, how can we value 
<BR>
them?
<BR>
<P>See nuthin' wrong with that
<BR>
<EM>&gt;either. However, I'm getting a bit tired of this activism thing, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;least in science goals are clearer, and there is a clear metric of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;progress. Otherwise one might wind up looking a bit like these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stick-dry Objectivist Institute dudes, or the Sceptics Society. You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know. They're there, but they're not quite there.
</EM><BR>
<P>Will it be like that forever? Scientific philosophy could change, and 
<BR>
politics (the way of realising morality in society) influences sciences too. 
<BR>
Shutting oneself in the Ivory Tower isn't a good solution, then people 
<BR>
outside might really turn into angry peasants, that do not see the value or 
<BR>
practicality of science (if the scientific institutes wouldn't dry up much 
<BR>
earlier because of lack of scientists).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &gt; [mucho interesting ruminations snipped]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; A change of strategy is at hand, I think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; Like our opponents say, this is World War IV. And if we don't 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understand
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; this and form ourselves into a better fighting force they will win,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; unopposed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't see the instrumentality of the continued us-them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;polarization. First of all, this could really eventually lead to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;radicalization, including violence on either or both sides, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would seem monumentally dumb. Even our opponents can't help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contributing to the cosa nostra by not dropping out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economics/rat race. Why don't you give them a break?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that you grossly underestimate the power of ideas in a society. If 
<BR>
you consider the idea that cloning is immoral and unpractical you would try 
<BR>
to stop those lunatics too from developing it, wouldn´t you? These ideas are 
<BR>
gaining ground since there isn't any alternative, and people will follow bad 
<BR>
and old ideas if there aren't any new or good ones. All the while a small 
<BR>
bunch of transhumanists sit in basements saying that &quot;nanotech is cool, huh, 
<BR>
huh, huh&quot;. I wouldn't take those ideas of how my future should be seriously.
<BR>
<P>I wasn't talking about MINDLESS activism (which unfortunately is the way 
<BR>
many see activism today). The WW4 will be fought inside people's heads, over 
<BR>
the ideas that they value or discard. It will probably not come to armed 
<BR>
fighting, if our opponents win, transhumanism will have since long stopped 
<BR>
being a relevant idea in people's opinions and in the cultural climate. 
<BR>
Armed revolutions seldom happen, ideological revolutions are much more 
<BR>
common. And the important force (at first) in that war, are the gatekeepers 
<BR>
of information: the intellectuals, and the majority don't sympathize with 
<BR>
us- actually quite the opposite in too many cases.
<BR>
<P>And they wont give us a break. They might want to &quot;drop out of the rat 
<BR>
race&quot;, but they certainly wont let us keep going- since we could endanger 
<BR>
them with our unpractial and immoral behaviour.
<BR>
<P>No equivalent of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;neoludd PETA is going to pump you full of lead in the parking lot in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;front of your house yet,
</EM><BR>
<P>The word is &quot;yet&quot;. But watch them gain political power since no one 
<BR>
contradicts them. But it perhaps wouldn´t have to come to that, since my 
<BR>
transhumanism would be impossible to practice in a negative cultural 
<BR>
climate.
<BR>
<P>and I see no diabolical mad scientist world
<BR>
<EM>&gt;domination plans to be conducted in remote mountaintop castle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;laboratories being hatched here, so why can't we all get along. Some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;folks are concerned about electrosmog, or genetically engineered food,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so what. They might not be scientifically schooled, and thus their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opposition lacking rigeur,
</EM><BR>
<P>Aren't there any scientifically schooled such persons? They are not 
<BR>
stereotypical hippies all, you know. And without transhuman scientists 
<BR>
taking action in the debate, even charlatans will be believed.
<BR>
<P>but their concerns are valid. Instead of
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;you ludd, no good&quot;, how about some gentle education?
</EM><BR>
<P>Why should I consider some gentle education in something I regard as immoral 
<BR>
and unpractical? It is just bunk! Why should I permit the development of 
<BR>
technologies that endanger the whole of humanity, I don't want to die! Why 
<BR>
should I face the possiblity of letting my children growing up in the 
<BR>
callous, mechanized society were a blind technology steals the caring ties 
<BR>
between humans? After all, present technology could give everyone an 
<BR>
incredible living standard if we just redistributed the riches, this could 
<BR>
be done without all the dangers present in technological development. The 
<BR>
scope of transhumanism is certainly that of creating an elite that will live 
<BR>
on the few resources left.
<BR>
<P>Explain to me how you can be a proponent of such a monstruos ideology?
<BR>
<P><P>I meet this often (even increasingly in some very important parts of the 
<BR>
cultural climate).
<BR>
<P>-&quot;Discussing genetically modified foods today is like discussing child 
<BR>
pornography&quot;
<BR>
VP of Novartis Seeds in an interview on Swedish television.
<BR>
Novartis has finally dropped out of the kiddie porn business
<BR>
<P>For instance, we
<BR>
<EM>&gt;do know about the rodent long-term mememory problems when irradiated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with cell-phone-type EM, and we do know that humankind tends to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generate pests, by introducing organisms from remote areas of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;globe with slightly differing fitness from those occupying a given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;niche, so that blanket assertions that release of genetically modified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;organisms into the environment could not lead to a yet another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;irritating man-made pest could be a bit premature? Not to speak about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seed-total herbicide packages, leading to monopolization of markets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reducing ecological and economical diversity.
</EM><BR>
<P>So why don't we ban that? What is it good for?
<BR>
