&lt;When he &lt;Randi&gt; passes judgment on people's philosophies; he moves from

skeptic to cynic. In my opinion cynicism is a philosophy unto itself, and
<BR>
one that I try to resist mightily.&gt;
<BR>
<P>Yes. Prof. Remo Ruffini (relativity, gravitation, etc.) wrote something
<BR>
interesting, about the Amazing, in a list directed by these gentlemen (see

The Religion of Skepticism has this one coming. Here it is Michael, Randi,

et al. 
<BR>
<P>(1) &gt;&gt;&gt;The problem I have with Ruffini's and Fuller's position is they
<BR>
absolutely rule out the value of skepticism. The show me and prove it

<P>I do Eh??? Then why have I ceaselessly advocated some of the great articles
<BR>
and books by some of the today¹s ORTHODOX PREEMINENT SKEPTICS in (i) CISCOP,

<BR>
absolutely rule out the value of skepticism. The show me and prove it
<BR>
attitude is what makes science truly unique from absolutism and monism.&lt;&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Ah yes, the old QUOTIDIAN James (the Amazing) Randi and Michael Shermer
<BR>
anti-everything-positivist version of Naïve Realism and The Skeptic Religion
<BR>
[but see the journals (i) The Skeptical Inquirer and (ii) Skeptic ­ a
<BR>
religion of science and skepticism alone]. What a simplistic creed (Randi?
<BR>
Shermer? or whomever). Indeed, you guys have made skepticism itself into
<BR>
Skepticism: A METAPHYSICAL dogma, and when practiced into a religion, just
<BR>
as adamantine and immutable and inflexible as are the dogmas of the
<BR>
traditional religions those of the radical postmodernists. You ask me to
<BR>
see the value of skepticism ­ no? Are you not really asking me to see the
<BR>
value of The Skeptic Religion instead? In either case, the metaphysical
<BR>
rejoinder would be that one just has to *assume,* at the very least, the
<BR>
CORRECTNESS of some kind of substance metaphysics (descriptive metaphysics)
<BR>
for this CREED OF SKEPTICISM to work at all ­ and, indeed, for science to
<BR>
make any sense on the common-sense-level you require of it.
<BR>
<P>With regard to the level of *credulity* in one of your
<BR>
pragmatist-buddy-heroes, viz., William James, I tell you that Bradley was
<BR>
one of the greatest Systematic Skeptics of his day. And it was *William
<BR>
James* who fell for some of the paranormalist and spiritualist Twaddle of
<BR>
those times and NOT Bradley. James wanted a &quot;pluralistic universe&quot; where
<BR>
all sorts of *supernatural* things and events and realities could possibly
<BR>
be. Bradley, OTOH, opted for a more rationalistic, monistic, and (dare I say
<BR>
it?!) SKEPTICAL view of the religious Inanity of his time
<BR>
<P>&quot;To the damning evidence of the so-called Spirit-Teachings no answer can be
<BR>
made. It would be unfair to say that the best of them are twaddle, and they
<BR>
perhaps may be compared with our own pulpit-utterances. They are often
<BR>
edifying, and often reasonable, and sometimes silly, and usually DULL.
<BR>
Still, to mention them in the same breath with the *best human work* would
<BR>
be wholly absurd. And it is an INFERIOR race [i.e., of alleged
<BR>
spirit-beings] which can produce nothing better.&quot; (Collected Essays, by
<BR>
F.H. Bradley, page 600)
<BR>
<P>Bradley concludes, contra William James, that even IF &quot;spiritualist&quot;
<BR>
phenomena were proved to be authentic, ANY religion based upon them would
<BR>
&quot;conflict with the best aspirations of the soul in a way in which *modern
<BR>
materialism* does not [for the reason that this would involve communication
<BR>
with spirits far inferior to ourselves that could provide us with ZERO
<BR>
illumination ­ of ANY kind].&quot;
<BR>
<P>Additionally, the dogma of Utter (i.e., radical, systematic) Skepticism is
<BR>
both self-refuting and self-stultifying. What Skeptic Religionists should
<BR>
do, here, is distinguish between (i) The Skeptic Religion, with James(the
<BR>
Amazing)Randi as one of its Highest Priests, and (ii) Particular Skepticism,
<BR>
and (iii) Radical Systematic Skepticism (of, say, a Humean kind) on the
<BR>
other. In short, what Skeptic Religionists should say about this matter,
<BR>
vis-à-vis science, is precisely what Sokal and Bricmont say in this regard
<BR>
<P>&quot;The universality of Humean skepticism [and, ipso facto, that of Randi and
<BR>
Shermer Skepticism] is also its [incredible] weakness. Of course, it is
<BR>
IRREFUTABLE. But since no one is systematically skeptical (when he or she
<BR>
is sincere) with respect to ordinary knowledge, one ought to ask WHY
<BR>
skepticism is rejected in that domain and WHY it would nevertheless be valid
<BR>
when applied elsewhere, for instance, to scientific knowledge.&quot; (Fashionable
<BR>
Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals¹ Abuse of Science, Alan Sokal and Jean
<BR>
Bricmont, Picador, 1998, page 55).
<BR>
<P>AND 
<BR>
<P>&quot;SPECIFIC SKEPTICISM SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH RADICAL SKEPTICISM. It is
<BR>
important to distinguish carefully between two different types of critiques
<BR>
of the sciences: those that are opposed to a PARTICULAR theory and are
<BR>
based on specific arguments, and those that repeat in one form or another
<BR>
the traditional arguments of radical skepticism. The former critiques can
<BR>
be interesting but can also be refuted, while the latter are irrefutable
<BR>
(because of their universality). And it is crucial NOT to mix the two sorts
<BR>
of arguments: for if one wants to contribute to science, be it natural or
<BR>
social, one must abandon radical doubts concerning the viability of logic or
<BR>
the possibility of knowing the world through observation and/or experiment.
<BR>
Of course, one can always have doubts about a specific theory. But general
<BR>
skeptical arguments put forward to support those doubts are IRRELEVANT,
<BR>
precisely because of their generality.&quot; (Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern
<BR>
Intellectuals¹ Abuse of Science, Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, Picador,
<BR>
1998, page 189) 
<BR>
<P>N.B!: Sokal¹s and Bricmont¹s book could, *mutatis mutandis,* be just as
<BR>
easily and appropriately entitled &quot;Fashionable Nonsense: The Modern
<BR>
Skeptics¹ Religion Movement Abuse of Science, Metaphysics, Epistemology, and
<BR>
Reason.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Worse, furthermore, is when Randi and Shermer turn skepticism into
<BR>
Skepticism. In such a case we often wind up with a banal version of
<BR>
James(the Amazing)Randi species of Naïve Realism. When one pushes Randi too
<BR>
far down the road of philosophy and academic metaphysics, he usually starts
<BR>
claiming how &quot;simple a soul&quot; he is, and that all this is far too extravagant
<BR>
for, to reiterate, &quot;simple souls&quot; like himself, rather than dealing with the
<BR>
philosophical and metaphysical arguments. Do, E.G., Shermer and Randi
<BR>
believe in an external world? Presumably the answer must be &quot;Yes.&quot; Do
<BR>
Randi and Shermer believe that common sense descriptions of mesoscopic
<BR>
reality are roughly correct? The answer, must again, be &quot;Yes.&quot; Do Randi
<BR>
and Shermer believe that, say, individual things are real and that change
<BR>
happens to and in them? The answer must, once again, be &quot;Yes.&quot; This, then,
<BR>
necessarily, commits them to what is called *descriptive metaphysics* or the
<BR>
ontology that undergirds the (metaphysical) claim that the ultimate
<BR>
furniture of the universe is constituted by a plurality of individual things
<BR>
as characterized by our common sense intuitions:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Metaphysics has been often revisionary, and less often descriptive.
<BR>
Descriptive metaphysics is content to describe the [claimed] actual
<BR>
structure of our thought about the world, revisionary metaphysics is
<BR>
concerned to produce a better structure. The productions of revisionary
<BR>
metaphysics remain permanently interesting, and not only as key episodes in
<BR>
the history of thought...&quot; (from Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive
<BR>
Metaphysics, by P.F. Strawson, Methuen, 1971, page 9)
<BR>
<P>Both Aristotle and Strawson are Descriptive Metaphysicians (in the old
<BR>
terminology, pluralistic substance ontologists), but the details of their
<BR>
respective systems do differ in some respects. What they have in common is
<BR>
that both begin from some very general common sense features of the
<BR>
relationship that human beings *possibly* have with the universe, conceived
<BR>
of as a collection of individual things that maintain themselves over
<BR>
against the environment. My claim, here, is that Randi, Shermer, and
<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:Scipolicy@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20psi%20as%20a%20boundary%20breaking%20possibility&In-Reply-To=&lt;B5969CB3.4285%25scerir@libero.it&gt;">Scipolicy@aol.com</A> should be more forthcoming about their metaphysical
<BR>
presuppositions and metaphysical systems, rather than *affecting* that they
<BR>
come from some allegedly absolutely neutral perspective (an epistemological
<BR>
myth) ­ a &quot;perspectiveless perspective&quot; ­ by which they can, in some way,
<BR>
legitimate their vague claims about the value of &quot;skepticism&quot; and advocate
<BR>
their religion of, again, The Skeptic Religion. What form of skepticism are
<BR>
they advocating here? Systematic? Merely particular? If systematic, then
<BR>
are not their doctrines just as irrefutable as are the doctrines of the
<BR>
radical social constructivists and contemporary antirealists? If
<BR>
particular, then they can take NO part in the metaphysical debate until they
<BR>
CON-descend (sorry for the pun, Masters of The Quotidian) to delineate their
<BR>
respective systems of metaphysics.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps even pluralistic substance ontologies are too sophisticated for
<BR>
alleged &quot;simple souls&quot; like Randi and Shermer. What, then, is/are their
<BR>
metaphysical doctrine/doctrines? Better is the question: What are their
<BR>
respective metaphysical doctrines? It seems to me the answer must be, in
<BR>
the case of some of them, &quot;A form of positivism.&quot; Many Skeptic Religionists
<BR>
would say this I hypothesize: &quot;Is not positivism a genuine alternative to
<BR>
the classical systems of metaphysics [ i.e., pluralistic substance
<BR>
ontologies, process ontologies, mechanistic ontologies, organicist (Absolute
<BR>
Idealist) ontologies]?&quot; NO, I say, because positivism either is (i) a form
<BR>
of Utter Skepticism about the nature of the world since, on this version of
<BR>
it, that nature is such that, by its very nature, it is unknowable by human
<BR>
beings, or (ii) if systematized into a determinate ontological claim, ends
<BR>
up by affirming the clandestine (disguised, occult) World Hypothesis (i.e.,
<BR>
metaphysical hypothesis) to the effect that
<BR>
<P>&quot;Suppose the whole body of data [of the sciences] should fall together into
<BR>
a single system on the basis of their own correlated probabilities, or, the
<BR>
other way round, suppose every area of experience were covered by formulas
<BR>
established by multiplicative corroboration, and that all these formulas
<BR>
were consistently gathered together in mathematical formŠ&quot; (from World
<BR>
Hypotheses, by Stephen C. Pepper, University of California Press, pages 335
<BR>
­ 336). This system would, our
<BR>
World-Hypothesis-affirming-Positivist-Skeptic-Religionists affirm, be an
<BR>
alternative to traditional systems of metaphysics. Pepper goes on to remark
<BR>
<P>&quot;Šthe nearest approximation to such an achievement is at present is in the
<BR>
domain of physics [as Victor Stenger fully realizes. THAT is why he is
<BR>
writing a book bearing the title &quot;Atomic Metaphysics: The Simplest of all
<BR>
possible Worlds&quot; ­ and here he argues for a species of DISCRTETE MECHANISTIC
<BR>
METPAHYSICS which models microphysical, mesoscopic, and cosmological reality
<BR>
on the basis of analogies with machines and via principles derived from
<BR>
machines], and it is questionable whether this achievement would be possible
<BR>
even there without the assumption and support of THE MECHSANISTIC CATEGRIES.
<BR>
  Certainly, in the past, every attempt to extend the achievement of the
<BR>
physical sciences as a consistent system beyond the subject matter of these
<BR>
sciences has resulted in some form of root-metaphor hypothesis, usually
<BR>
MECHSANISM.&quot; (World Hypotheses, page 336).
<BR>
<P>Ergo, &quot;The consistent development of an UNDOGMATIC POSITIVISM into a general
<BR>
hypothesis adequate to nature would turn out to be simply one of the
<BR>
root-metaphor hypotheses [i.e., traditional metaphysical systems] that we
<BR>
have already considered.&quot; (World Hypotheses, page 337).
<BR>
<P>Finally, Randi and Shermer might respond that I have it all wrong and that
<BR>
they both are actually pragmatists. Well, that too is a World Hypothesis
<BR>
asserting the ULTIMACY of processes and relations as fundamental
<BR>
metaphysical categories. (see &quot;Contextualism&quot; in World Hypotheses, pages 232
<BR>
­ 279 by Steven C. Pepper)
<BR>
<P>In the end, THE SKEPTIC RELIGION of Shermer and Randi seems to have its
<BR>
PREFFERED ORTHODOXY, whether this be positivism, naïve realism, pragmatism,
<BR>
or descriptive metaphysics. Sorry Skeptic Religionists, but you cannot
<BR>
escape from metaphysics ­ even in Science itself.
<BR>
<P>Regards for Now.
