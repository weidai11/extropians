THE CROSS AND THE PLUMBLINE - by Crichton Miller
<BR>
<P>Dear List Members
<BR>
<P>Chris Ogilvie-Herald has kindly allowed me space in his respected 
<BR>
news list, EGYPTNEWS, to share with you, what may become one of the 
<BR>
most enlightening discoveries. A key to both the past and the future 
<BR>
understanding of our distant ancestors. 
<BR>
<P>I am a Scottish born researcher and Company Director with an interest 
<BR>
in prehistory. I have applied for a patent on a derivative of the 
<BR>
Celtic cross.
<BR>
<P>This application was published on the 14th of June 2000 under UK 
<BR>
patent application GB 2 344 654 A
<BR>
<P>Despite intensive research by The Patent Office prior to publication, 
<BR>
no instrument with its complete attributes has been discovered and 
<BR>
its application was not found to be obvious.
<BR>
<P>The Celtic cross, which is an ancient and sacred symbol, with which 
<BR>
most people are familiar, appears to be a representation of an 
<BR>
ancient instrument that was used by our ancestors as far back as 
<BR>
Neolithic times.
<BR>
<P>I believe that it was what the Ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians used 
<BR>
to survey their buildings and navigate the oceans of the world.
<BR>
Despite the discovery of cocaine in some of the Egyptian Mummies, it 
<BR>
has been argued, in august and academic circles, that it was 
<BR>
impossible for them or the Phoenicians to have crossed the Atlantic 
<BR>
in prehistory, because of their inability to navigate.
<BR>
Thor Heyderhal scotched the concept that their boats were incapable 
<BR>
with his Ra expedition.
<BR>
<P>I am about to collapse the final argument, by proving that they could 
<BR>
navigate and had the instrument to do it. 
<BR>
<P>The discovery came about in the winter of 1997 when I was trying to 
<BR>
figure out what the Ancient Egyptians would have used to survey the 
<BR>
great pyramid complex at Giza.
<BR>
<P>All constructions, even ancient ones, require surveying before 
<BR>
commencement of work.
<BR>
<P>The incredible pyramid of Cheops and the Giza complex, which seems to 
<BR>
embody the mathematical value of PI, would have to be accurately 
<BR>
surveyed, as would all similar constructions, including stone circles 
<BR>
such as Stonehenge, Avebury and Callanish in Scotland. Callanish is 
<BR>
more than 5000 years old and built in the form of a Celtic cross. 
<BR>
Proof that this knowledge predates the Egyptian Pyramids.
<BR>
<P>Through intensive and exhaustive experimentation, a belief in the 
<BR>
intelligence of our ancestors and a refusal to believe in little 
<BR>
green men as the designers, I discovered that the only appropriate 
<BR>
instrument that could have been used by the architect, in the place 
<BR>
of a theodolite, was a derivative of the cross, with the addition of 
<BR>
a plumbline. This incredibly simple, yet complex instrument, has the 
<BR>
potential to measure angles and inclinations to an accuracy of 1 
<BR>
minute of arc or 1/60th of a degree, depending on the size of the 
<BR>
instrument used. This is an extraordinary accuracy for what appears 
<BR>
to be only two pieces of wood, a scale and a plumbline. One of the 
<BR>
most interesting but obscure abilities of the Cross is its capability 
<BR>
to take sidereal measurements.
<BR>
<P>With my experience of navigation as a qualified Yachtmaster, I turned 
<BR>
my experimentation to discover if the ancient mariners could find 
<BR>
latitude and longitude with the cross. The experiments conducted, 
<BR>
confirmed that the ancients could find their position anywhere on the 
<BR>
Earth within 3 nautical miles with a hand held device. This discovery 
<BR>
may help to prove that it was possible for sailors such as the 
<BR>
Phoenicians to have made regular trading contact with the Americas in 
<BR>
pre Columbian times.  It also may explain the mysterious navigation 
<BR>
skills of the Polynesians. This discovery also helps support pioneers 
<BR>
of the theory of ancient intercontinental travel such as Thor 
<BR>
Heyderhal with his Kon Tiki and Ra expeditions.
<BR>
<P>I then went on to discover that this instrument was probably the 
<BR>
basis of geometry, mathematics, ancient astronomy, map making and 
<BR>
time keeping.
<BR>
<P>That this instrument was used in combination with a detailed 
<BR>
knowledge of astronomy and monthly star positions, ecliptic and 
<BR>
zodiac observations so as to locate the position of any star at any 
<BR>
time over a location on the earth's surface. Hence the saying &quot;as in 
<BR>
heaven so on earth&quot;
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, those observers were placed at strategic observatories 
<BR>
throughout the known world to keep local time and traditions and to 
<BR>
aid mariners and other travelers.
<BR>
<P>Those travelers were able to find their longitude over short 
<BR>
distances with the use of sand (hour) glasses in relation to local 
<BR>
time between observatories (stone or wood henges in the north and 
<BR>
pyramids in the lower latitudes) and world time kept at the old 0 
<BR>
degree meridian at Giza.
<BR>
<P>I also believe that the henges were used to keep time and in fact 
<BR>
were large astrolabes where stone balls were moved around the henge 
<BR>
on a daily basis to represent the positions of the planets in 
<BR>
relation to the sun and zodiac throughout the year.
<BR>
<P>That Ley (lay) lines, an ancient and modern navigation term, were 
<BR>
used to lay the position line, or course, of one place in relation to 
<BR>
another. This term is misconstrued to have magical or magnetic 
<BR>
properties by modern cultists. It is in fact related to astro 
<BR>
navigation and can be found in modern navigation manuals. The lay 
<BR>
line from the Cape Verde Islands to the Caribbean Antilles, avoiding 
<BR>
the Sargasso Sea is exactly 17 degrees North.
<BR>
<P>To find this line an instrument that measures the declination of a 
<BR>
star or the sun at azimuth would have to be used. I believe that this 
<BR>
instrument was the Cross with a plumbline.
<BR>
<P>I also believe that the quadrant, used in the 13th century was an 
<BR>
inferior instrument in that it was incapable of sidereal measurements.
<BR>
<P>I further believe that the Cross and the methods of its use, is one 
<BR>
of the greatest treasures found by the famous Knights Templar, in 
<BR>
their excavation of Solomon's Temple, during the Crusades.
<BR>
That this discovery led to a new style of architecture and the 
<BR>
building of the Great Cathedrals in Europe, starting with Chartres in 
<BR>
France.
<BR>
<P>It may also have led to the greatest untold confidence trick in the 
<BR>
last millennium played on Spain by Christopher Columbus and 
<BR>
eventually leading to the destruction of the Amerindian civilizations.
<BR>
There is evidence that the Templars, to whom Columbus was associated, 
<BR>
had been voyaging to the Americas for two hundred years before the 
<BR>
official discovery. Using the cross as a navigation instrument. The 
<BR>
Templar Archivist has already argued at Roslyn Chapel in Scotland, 
<BR>
that William St Claire had voyaged to America before Columbus.
<BR>
The fact that the instrument actually works and can be demonstrated 
<BR>
to fulfil a universal role in many functions, is vindication of my 
<BR>
theories.
<BR>
<P>What is truly amazing, is that no one has discovered this lost 
<BR>
knowledge in modern times.
<BR>
<P>The message in stone, wood, metals and art has been around for 
<BR>
thousands of years, in full view of the public.
<BR>
<P>Apart from the publication of the patent, I have been asked to 
<BR>
publish and had accepted an academic 20,000-word paper, with 38 
<BR>
technical illustrations in the November 2000 issue of Fortean 
<BR>
Studies. This article will be of great interest to those studying 
<BR>
Egyptian constructions, but unfortunately can not be revealed until 
<BR>
after publication comes out. In this paper I have outlined the 
<BR>
methods used to tell the time and navigate with the combination of 
<BR>
the cross, pyramids, stone circles and henges.
<BR>
<P>I have also been asked to appear at the next Fortean Unconvention in 
<BR>
London to speak about my discoveries.
<BR>
<P>I have accepted that my name be put forward.
<BR>
<P>I have appeared for 15 minutes in May 1999 on Teidi Television, 
<BR>
following a lecture he gave to a conference on Mayan Culture in 
<BR>
Tenerife. After gifting a working model of the Cross to Don 
<BR>
Ajlehandro. Head Elder of forty-five Elders and spiritual leader of 
<BR>
6,000,000 Maya people. The only person allowed by the authorities to 
<BR>
conduct ancient ceremonies on the Yucatan Pyramids. The last ceremony 
<BR>
held at that time had in attendance every Amerindian Tribal Chief 
<BR>
from Tierra del Feugo to Alaska.
<BR>
<P>Don Ajlehandro said that it was his people's lost &quot;Staff of Power&quot; 
<BR>
used to design pyramids and lost when the Conquistadors dispossessed 
<BR>
them 500 years ago. He promised to show it to his Elders and place it 
<BR>
for instruction of the young in the Maya Mystery Schools.
<BR>
A small article has been purchased by Practical Boatowner magazine 
<BR>
and is due for publication showing how the instrument can be easily 
<BR>
used as an emergency navigation backup in case of electronic 
<BR>
navigation system failures.
<BR>
<P>Apart from being a help to Archaeologists, in piecing together the 
<BR>
unexplained mysteries and purposes of the pyramids of Egypt, Mexico, 
<BR>
Peru, Stonehenge and other ancient constructions, I hope that my 
<BR>
discovery will be an enlightenment to all seekers after the truth.
<BR>
That this discovery will enlighten all people about our past and 
<BR>
inspire other researchers, helping to further our knowledge and 
<BR>
understand the obscure culture of the ancients.
<BR>
<P>I hope that I can find further sponsorship and assistance in 
<BR>
providing the instrument to developing countries for a cheap and 
<BR>
efficient method of surveying projects such as construction, road 
<BR>
building and irrigation.
<BR>
<P>I also hope, that this instrument may be used in the practical 
<BR>
education of the young, so that they may gain a basic and interesting 
<BR>
foundation of this ancient knowledge.
<BR>
T
<BR>
hat they may learn how our ancestors survived and learnt about 
<BR>
astronomy, navigation, construction, mathematics, geometry and time 
<BR>
keeping.
<BR>
<P>How they went on to apply this knowledge, which is lost in the mists 
<BR>
of time, to construct the ancient wonders of the world and achieve 
<BR>
the seemingly impossible.
<BR>
<P>I am presently compiling my research, with the aim of completing my 
<BR>
first book by the spring of 2001.
