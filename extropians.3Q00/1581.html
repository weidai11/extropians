</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;Edinburgh University scientists say the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; clinical trials of a male contraceptive pill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; suggest it is 100% effective, with no harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consequences. &quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But after discussing the idea of a male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pill with lots of different women, I discovered that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the (then) prevalent attitude was that it didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;matter if there was a male pill because men could not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;really be trusted to take it.  I heard things like,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;Well, if I was living with the guy and I actually saw
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;him take it then I guess it would be OK, but if I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;just dating some guy, I'm not going to take the chance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of getting pregnant on his say-so that he took the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pill.  I'd have to take my own precautions to be on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the safe side anyway.&quot;  The article says only 2%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wouldn't trust their partner to take the new pill.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Where do you live?
<BR>
I have heard this a lot since moving to Utah and I thought it was derived 
<BR>
from the marriage-oriented culture here. But it seems to be the general 
<BR>
assumption that men would not bother to take the 30 seconds per day which it 
<BR>
takes to take a pill, because they secretly want to get women pregnant so 
<BR>
they can get married and have a family. This is really, really 
<BR>
counterintuitive. Most women I know want to have children one day, many of 
<BR>
them soon - do most men want to have children?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;One concern that a friend of mine expressed is that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;those men least likely to take the male pill are the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignorant, the stupid, and the lazy while those most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;likely to take the pill are on the other end of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spectrum.  Not particularly good news for the gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pool.  This friend of mine also suggested that men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will now have even more of a propinquity to engage in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;meaningless sexual encounters and women's psyches will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continue to harbor resentment toward themselves, men,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and society in general because of this behavior.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Who was it here who suggested a genetic engineering solution by which people 
<BR>
are born (or made to be, through gene therapy), infertile, and then have to 
<BR>
take a fertility pill to replentish whatever chemical their bodies have been 
<BR>
made unable to produce in order to have children. This is an excellent idea, 
<BR>
and I hope a gene therapy solution will soon be in the works. I have another 
<BR>
idea which may or may not be workable, I dont know - but a vasectomy which, 
<BR>
rather then simply severing the tube and letting the ends heal, puts a 
<BR>
&quot;switch&quot; between both ends - some kind of pump, or better yet, a tube which 
<BR>
can switch from open to contracted states chemically. By a remote control, 
<BR>
or by taking a pill (one time), you turn the switch to open or closed to let 
<BR>
sperm pass through, depending on whether you want children or not. Problem: 
<BR>
people are still fertile up to a month after a vasectomy from sperm leftover 
<BR>
in the tubes and I'd expect this to be an issue here too. I think this would 
<BR>
be a small problem, as people would not be changing their minds once a week 
<BR>
about having children.
<BR>
I pondered the idea of learning how to do this myself and building my own - 
<BR>
knowing how I am with building things, I would end up with a foot-long 
<BR>
length of rubber hose extending from my scrotum.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Sometimes it seems like this notion that recreational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sex is a bad thing is primarily propagated by those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;women who continue to perceive the need for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long-term commitment from a man before they can feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comfortable in a relationship and this appears to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;carryover from the days when women depended heavily
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;upon men's resources for their well-being and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well-being of their children.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's certainly half of it...
<BR>
The other half comes from men - guys who will lose respect for a woman and 
<BR>
think of her as a &quot;slut&quot; after she sleeps with him. I think this is less 
<BR>
common today, but certainly in the past (from what I have read and observed 
<BR>
of some old people), the idea is that a good woman, the kind who you marry, 
<BR>
is one who doesn't really like sex too much but will &quot;let you&quot; do it to her, 
<BR>
as a matrimonial duty. These are the kind for having children with. The 
<BR>
other kind is the kind for having enjoyable sex with, and are often 
<BR>
prostitutes. This attitude is expressed very well by a character in &quot;Summer 
<BR>
of Sam&quot; if you've seen it (a pretty bad movie, actually). You would also be 
<BR>
familiar with it if you know anyone in a frat. If you ever see a book called 
<BR>
&quot;Deviant behavior&quot; (sociology book) look up the number of men who have lost 
<BR>
their virginity to prostitutes today, compared to thoe who did in the 1940s 
<BR>
- I don't remember the statistic but it's the opposite of what you would 
<BR>
think.. severalfold higher in the 40s. Also, often people who are arrested 
<BR>
for prostitution (some cities publish this data in papers) are very 
<BR>
conservative, traditional types of men.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;My hope is that the male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pill will indeed take us a step closer toward a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relaxed attitude toward our sexuality, but not a more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relaxed attitude toward the responsibilities of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marriage and/or family. We really need to get past the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paradigm where women sort men by the size of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;wallets and men sort women by their potential for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sexual gratification. I have to admit though, these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hopes are probably unrealistic on my part.
</EM><BR>
<P>Also required are cures for various STDs.
<BR>
Ideally: full cures and vaccines for HIV, herpes, and HPV, (are 
<BR>
cures/vaccines for the latter two being worked on anyplace?) as well as a 
<BR>
wider testing for bacterial STDs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What are some of the other Male Pill issues being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;debated?
