Biotech Research Branches Out
<BR>
By Rick Weiss
<BR>
Washington Post Staff Writer
<BR>
Thursday, August 3, 2000; Page A01
<BR>
In an orchard in western Canada, genetically enhanced fruit trees kill
<BR>
insects on contact without pesticide sprays. Soon they will bear apples
<BR>
whose crispy white flesh won't turn brown even hours after being cut.
<BR>
In Israel, poplar trees have been made to grow so fast that they could
<BR>
eliminate the need to log old-growth forests, while gobbling enough carbon
<BR>
dioxide to help slow global warming.
<BR>
In North Carolina and Minnesota, experimental trees containing novel woody
<BR>
fibers can be digested into pulp without the tons of toxic chemicals that
<BR>
today poison the rivers around paper mills.
<BR>
These dream trees and others with equally attractive traits are growing on
<BR>
scores of test plots around the world, part of a little-noted biotech
<BR>
revolution in forestry that experts predict will hit its commercial stride
<BR>
in the next five years.
<BR>
Building on a decade of practice in crops such as soybeans and cotton,
<BR>
researchers at universities and at a few biotechnology companies have been
<BR>
perfecting the art of injecting novel genes into the cells of trees. Now,
<BR>
scientists say, they are poised to harness the enormous economic potential
<BR>
of the biggest, longest-lived and most biologically productive land plants
<BR>
on Earth.
<BR>
Yet for all the promise that foresters see in the newly dawning era of
<BR>
genetically engineered trees, others see an ecological crisis in the making.
<BR>
Trees can live hundreds of times longer than the biotech food crops already
<BR>
on the market, critics note. That makes it difficult to predict the
<BR>
long-term impact of genetically altered trees on the countless species that
<BR>
depend on them, including the soil-dwelling fungi and microbes that are the
<BR>
foundation of the planet's terrestrial food chain.
<BR>
Opponents fear that biotech trees, to which scientists have added genes
<BR>
from bacteria, chickens and even humans, will provide poor habitats for
<BR>
beneficial insects and birds, transforming biologically diverse woodlands
<BR>
into sterile &quot;Frankenforests.&quot;
<BR>
They also warn that genes conferring resistance to leaf-chewing pests and
<BR>
chemical herbicides, which researchers are adding to tree DNA, may spread
<BR>
via windblown pollen to related tree species, creating woody weeds with
<BR>
unnatural advantages over their ancient cousins.
<BR>
The emerging debate over genetically modified trees echoes the one already
<BR>
plaguing biotech agriculture, but with added scientific concerns unique to
<BR>
trees. The issue also strikes an emotional chord not engendered by
<BR>
genetically altered farm crops because it focuses on some of the most
<BR>
beloved and majestic life forms on Earth.
<BR>
The stakes in the looming battle over biotech trees are high. Wood products
<BR>
amount to a $400 billion global industry, and the demand for paper and pulp
<BR>
products is expected to increase by 50 percent in the next two decades,
<BR>
exceeding supplies by 2010. At the same time there is growing pressure to
<BR>
save the world's remaining forests for wilderness and recreational purposes.
<BR>
That fundamental conflict between consumption and conservation has both
<BR>
sides of the molecular forestry debate waving environmental banners.
<BR>
Proponents say biotech trees offer the only way to increase the production
<BR>
of lumber, paper and other wood products without decimating existing
<BR>
forests and exacerbating global warming.
<BR>
&quot;For every tree farm that produces twice the usual amount of wood on an
<BR>
acre of land you can leave an acre of natural forest alone,&quot; said Ron
<BR>
Sederoff, director of the forest biotechnology group at North Carolina
<BR>
State University.
<BR>
Increasing Production
<BR>
In the past decade, about 130 outdoor tests of genetically modified trees
<BR>
have gotten the go-ahead from the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant
<BR>
Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which has primary responsibility for
<BR>
regulating bioengineered trees in this country--more than half of them in
<BR>
the past 2 1/2 years. The first applications for permission to grow large
<BR>
commercial tracts of the new trees are expected to come around 2005.
<BR>
Dozens of additional outdoor tests are underway in at least 16 countries,
<BR>
notably Chile, Uruguay and Indonesia, according to the World Wide Fund of
<BR>
Britain, an environmental group that has called for tighter regulation of
<BR>
tree engineering and a global moratorium on commercial releases.
<BR>
In many cases, it's impossible to say exactly what scientists are putting
<BR>
into the trees. Although APHIS's Web site summarizes every application for
<BR>
field tests, many say simply &quot;CBI,&quot; for &quot;confidential business
<BR>
information,&quot; in the column that is supposed to describe which gene is
<BR>
being studied and which organism it came from.
<BR>
But available government records and interviews with scientists indicate
<BR>
that research is largely focused on aspens and cottonwoods, both members of
<BR>
the poplar family, which are favorites of the paper and pulp industry. Of
<BR>
particular interest are genes that reduce the amount of a substance called
<BR>
lignin, or that weaken lignin's chemical structure. Lignin is the tough
<BR>
arboreal &quot;connective tissue&quot; that today must be chemically degraded at
<BR>
enormous expense in the process of turning trees into paper.
<BR>
Researchers also are adding genes that spur faster growth and increase the
<BR>
concentration of cellulose, the ingredient of prime commercial value in
<BR>
trees. &quot;The idea is to change the tree's genetic regulation to put more
<BR>
available light energy into cellulose production,&quot; said Michael Moynihan of
<BR>
InterLink Biotechnologies LLC in Princeton, N.J., which is part of a
<BR>
Chilean biotechnology concern.
<BR>
And scientists are learning how to block the growth of flowers, pine cones
<BR>
and seeds in trees to focus more of the plants' energy on wood fiber
<BR>
production and to keep novel packets of DNA from spreading to other
<BR>
trees--a concern not only of environmentalists but also of corporate patent
<BR>
lawyers who don't want to lose control of their proprietary genes.
<BR>
Fast-growing forest trees could do more than increase the world's supply of
<BR>
lumber and pulp. They might also help reduce global warming.
<BR>
Through photosynthesis, trees consume large amounts of carbon dioxide
<BR>
(CO2), a greenhouse gas produced by automobiles and other industrial
<BR>
sources whose emissions the world's countries have pledged to reduce under
<BR>
the terms of the pending Kyoto Protocol.
<BR>
Amid growing uncertainty that the signers of that accord will be able to
<BR>
achieve its goals, there is talk of creating a system of &quot;carbon credits&quot;
<BR>
that might allow countries with many CO2-gulping forests to sell their
<BR>
excess air-scrubbing capacity to nations falling short of their clean-air
<BR>
goals. The approach is supported by some in the oil and automotive
<BR>
industries, including Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., which has its own forest
<BR>
biotechnology program.
<BR>
&quot;Our laboratories are working to develop strains of trees that are
<BR>
especially efficient at photosynthesis,&quot; states a Toyota summary of the
<BR>
company's efforts. Once those carbon-consuming trees are developed, the
<BR>
company explains, &quot;we can clone thousands more exactly the same.
<BR>
Eventually, while paying close attention to the ecological balance, we hope
<BR>
to have whole forests of these extra-efficient trees, to help purify the
<BR>
atmosphere.&quot;
<BR>
Other genetically modified trees may help clean up contaminated land. The
<BR>
one tree listed by APHIS as having been endowed with a human gene is a
<BR>
poplar with a stretch of human DNA that can break up cancer-causing dioxins
<BR>
and the toxic breakdown products of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).
<BR>
Bearing Fruit?
<BR>
Orchard growers have their own reasons for tinkering with genes, and APHIS
<BR>
has approved field trials of more than 50 genetically altered variants of
<BR>
apples, grapefruits, pears, persimmons, plums and walnuts in 18 states,
<BR>
most on small sites of an acre or two.
<BR>
USDA scientists, for example, recently created a plum containing viral DNA
<BR>
that makes the fruit resistant to plum pox, a fruit-deforming disease that
<BR>
has cost growers millions of dollars in Europe and arrived in the United
<BR>
States last fall. &quot;The trees essentially vaccinate themselves,&quot; said Ralph
<BR>
Scorza, who led the work in West Virginia at a location he keeps secret
<BR>
because of fears that protesters will damage the site.
<BR>
Another priority is the creation of patented specialty fruits with improved
<BR>
flavors or other consumer-friendly traits.
<BR>
&quot;Everyone recognizes that the money in the tree fruit industry of the
<BR>
future is going to come from new varieties with exclusive rights,&quot; said
<BR>
Neal Carter, president of Okanagan Biotechnology of Summerland, B.C. Carter
<BR>
has planted about 800 genetically altered trees, the oldest of which are
<BR>
just a year short of fruit-bearing age.
<BR>
Next fall, with great anticipation, Carter will cut into the first of his
<BR>
genetically altered apples endowed with DNA to block the chemical reaction
<BR>
that makes the flesh turn brown after the fruit is bitten or cut. If the
<BR>
gene works, he said, &quot;you'll be able to cut this apple up and put it in the
<BR>
lunch bag and the kid might actually eat it.&quot;
<BR>
Among the other new fruits Carter foresees coming to market in the next
<BR>
decade are peaches engineered to ripen more slowly and deliciously after
<BR>
harvest and cherries in a variety of fashionable new colors.
<BR>
That's assuming, he adds, that the research is allowed to move forward.
<BR>
In fact, advocates opposed to biotech trees are becoming increasingly vocal
<BR>
and active. In March, the Boston-based Native Forest Network, the
<BR>
Rainforest Action Network of San Francisco and a Uruguayan ecology group
<BR>
launched an international public relations campaign against genetically
<BR>
engineered trees. Other activists have conducted nighttime raids on tree
<BR>
test plots in the United States, Canada and Europe, destroying years of
<BR>
work and contributing to the decision by at least one corporation to drop
<BR>
its efforts.
<BR>
Zeneca Plant Science, a major European biotechnology concern, recently
<BR>
abandoned its foray into biotech forestry, saying it became disenchanted
<BR>
after protesters ruined its sole stand of trees last summer. St.
<BR>
Louis-based Monsanto and Royal Dutch Shell also quit the field in the past
<BR>
two years, citing unspecified &quot;business&quot; considerations.
<BR>
&quot;The main risk of working with engineered trees is not a biological risk,
<BR>
it's a political risk because of the hysteria around the world,&quot; said
<BR>
Steven Strauss, who is developing genetically modified trees at Oregon
<BR>
State University in Corvallis.
<BR>
Like the conflict over genetically altered crops, the war of words over
<BR>
genetically altered trees tends to be extremely polarized. Opponents warn
<BR>
of irreversible genetic pollution, while proponents claim that new traits
<BR>
are unlikely to persist in the wild.
<BR>
Nonetheless, even biotech-friendly foresters agree that some concerns
<BR>
cannot just be waved away.
<BR>
Some suspect, for example, that low-lignin trees may prove especially
<BR>
vulnerable to insect infestation, which could harm surrounding forests. And
<BR>
if low-lignin genes do spread, then surrounding trees might degrade faster
<BR>
than usual and deprive many species of the crucial habitat now afforded by
<BR>
slowly rotting wood.
<BR>
Opponents also predict that plantations of fast-growing trees will require
<BR>
large amounts of water, fertilizer and pesticides, undercutting their
<BR>
usefulness as a hedge against global warming. They're asking whether
<BR>
genetically altered trees will cause allergies in people not usually
<BR>
bothered by tree pollen. And they wonder what will happen to the birds,
<BR>
insects and other wildlife that depend on tree pollen, nectar and seeds if
<BR>
scientists plant large expanses of sterile trees whose reproductive
<BR>
energies have been diverted to fuel extra growth.
<BR>
Assessing the Risks
<BR>
Ultimately, questions about safety will have to be resolved by data, not
<BR>
debate. But opponents say regulatory standards are not tough enough.
<BR>
The restrictions on outdoor testing of genetically modified trees are
<BR>
virtually identical to those already in place for annual crops, they note.
<BR>
In most cases, growers must simply sign a statement promising they will
<BR>
follow general guidelines to protect the environment.
<BR>
&quot;The current rules are not very stringent and are not well policed, and
<BR>
there are a lot of different risk issues that ought to be addressed
<BR>
thoroughly before these trees get commercialized,&quot; said Jane Rissler of the
<BR>
Union of Concerned Scientists.
<BR>
Unfortunately, federal funding of experiments to assess risks of engineered
<BR>
trees is scant, said Dave Ellis, who conducted seminal work on genetically
<BR>
altered spruce trees at the University of Wisconsin and is now at CellFor
<BR>
Inc., a biotech tree company in Victoria, B.C. Ellis tried several times to
<BR>
get federal money for ecological studies of low-lignin wood while he was at
<BR>
Wisconsin, he said, but to no avail.
<BR>
Federal regulators say they are on top of the issue.
<BR>
&quot;USDA recognizes that there are environmental, scientific and other issues
<BR>
that need to be carefully considered and addressed before genetically
<BR>
engineered trees are used commercially,&quot; said Michael Schechtman, the
<BR>
agency's biotechnology coordinator. When the USDA receives its first
<BR>
request for commercial approval of a biotech tree, he said, it will be
<BR>
considered &quot;in an open and public process.&quot;
<BR>
The department may also soon ask a special committee of the National
<BR>
Academy of Sciences to investigate the risks and benefits of biotech trees.
<BR>
And biotech foods such as fruits and nuts will have to pass additional
<BR>
muster with the Food and Drug Administration, Schechtman said--and with the
<BR>
Environmental Protection Agency if they contain any insect-killing genes.
<BR>
If activists have their way, that will be a long process.
<BR>
But every year of delay can only hurt what's left of Earth's remaining
<BR>
forests, said Kenneth Munson of ArborGen in Savannah, Ga., a biotech tree
<BR>
venture that includes woodland-product giants International Paper and
<BR>
Westvaco and two New Zealand companies.
<BR>
&quot;We have great confidence in the American people,&quot; Munson said. &quot;We think
<BR>
they are knowledgeable and pragmatic and we look forward to a rational
<BR>
discussion of this.&quot;
