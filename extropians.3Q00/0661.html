<P>Think again, John.  I hate to be the one who consistently sounds what amounts

to an &quot;un-optimistic&quot; note here, but I frankly think the time has come for

proponents of technological and scientific progress to wake up and smell the

roses -- pun intended.  We are consistently losing the battle for public

opinion.  Genetic engineering technologies are advancing WAY faster than its

proponents are realizing, in an important sense -- and that sense is the

public at large's acceptance of the technology.  Read the following article 
<BR>
that is representative of the coverage this specific development is getting.  
<BR>
The luddites are well organized, have a simple, consistent theme and are 
<BR>
getting better and better at getting themselves insserted into every single

news item announcing any progress.  I'm sorry to say it, but as someone who 
<BR>
works in the arena of public persuasion, I have to say we're losing -- and

badly.

Genetically altered grass that would always be green has foes red-hot
<BR>
<P>By DAVID BARBOZA - The New York Times
<BR>
Date: 07/08/00 22:15
<BR>
<P>MARYSVILLE, Ohio -- Standing in long rows in Greenhouse No. 3 at the Scotts
<BR>
Co.'s research laboratory are pots of grass that could be a suburbanite's
<BR>
dream come true.
<BR>
<P>The grass, which Scotts hopes will eventually carpet every lawn and golf
<BR>
course around the world, is genetically altered to withstand applications of
<BR>
the most potent weedkillers and remain healthy and green.
<BR>
<P>Scotts, the world's largest maker of lawn and turf products, has other
<BR>
varieties in the works as well. One, nicknamed &quot;low mow&quot; by company
<BR>
scientists, has been designed to grow at a slower pace, thereby reducing the
<BR>
need for a lawn mower. Other strains could be drought-resistant, or bred to
<BR>
flourish in the winter.
<BR>
<P>The company is also working on genetically modified roses and other flowers
<BR>
that will bloom longer than the ones found in nature. And some scientists at
<BR>
Scotts are even talking about someday developing grasses in different
<BR>
colors.
<BR>
<P>Critics are horrified.
<BR>
<P>Environmental activists -- already concerned about the genetically modified
<BR>
crops growing on more than 70 million acres of American farmland -- have
<BR>
criticized research laboratories experimenting with genetically altered
<BR>
grass and trees out of fear that the plants will fundamentally alter the
<BR>
environment. Others are speaking out against this latest form of genetic
<BR>
experimentation.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is going to put biotech in everyone's back yard,&quot; said Jeremy Rifkin,
<BR>
a longtime opponent of biotechnology. &quot;It's going to open up a national
<BR>
debate, because everyone has a lawn. You're going to see a `not in my back
<BR>
yard' phenomenon.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The American Society of Landscape Architects, with more than 14,000 members,
<BR>
joined Rifkin on Friday in petitioning the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
<BR>
calling for the agency to suspend all field tests of the new grasses that
<BR>
Scotts and Monsanto, a biotech partner, are conducting.
<BR>
<P>&quot;We are highly concerned with the use of genetically modified plants because
<BR>
they could potentially affect the whole ecosystem of native plants,&quot; said
<BR>
Janice Cervelli Schach, president of the society. &quot;We want bodies outside of
<BR>
Monsanto and Scotts to assess these risks.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Many consumers are also wary.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This whole genetic thing has gotten out of hand,&quot; said Nancy Childs, 29,
<BR>
who was loading her cart with black-eyed Susans at a Home Depot store in
<BR>
Chicago. Genetically altered grass would be &quot;convenient, but it's not
<BR>
normal,&quot; she said.
<BR>
<P>Scotts says it is moving cautiously. It says it is conducting intensive
<BR>
research under the oversight of federal regulators to ensure that the new
<BR>
products are safe, and to avoid the maelstrom that has erupted, at least in
<BR>
Europe, over genetically altered crops.
<BR>
<P>The Agriculture Department regulates where Scotts can plant the experimental
<BR>
grass, and Scotts must obtain the department's permission before it can
<BR>
transport the grass anywhere.
<BR>
<P>&quot;These products will give you more beautiful lawns and gardens,&quot; said Mark
<BR>
R. Schwartz, head of the branded plants group at Scotts, which is based in
<BR>
Columbus, Ohio. &quot;And if there are problems with the technology, then it
<BR>
won't come out. But we're following all the rules, taking all the
<BR>
precautions.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Scotts is far ahead of its competitors in the race to create the raw
<BR>
material for perfect lawns.
<BR>
<P>&quot;That's how we make money, beautifying the world, trying to generate more
<BR>
beauty with less maintenance,&quot; said Charles M. Berger, the company's chief
<BR>
executive. &quot;And we'll use every tool in the toolbox. Biotech -- that's just
<BR>
another tool in the toolbox.&quot;
<BR>
<P>A company in Australia has been trying to create a blue rose through the use
<BR>
of biotechnology, but scientists at Scotts have already developed
<BR>
genetically altered petunias and geraniums in laboratories in St. Louis.
<BR>
<P>Scotts said it will develop an even larger arsenal of &quot;smart&quot; plants with
<BR>
longer-lasting blooms, different colors and, in some cases, built-in
<BR>
pesticide.
<BR>
<P>Genetically altered grass, however, may be the first bioengineered lawn
<BR>
product to reach the market. Scientists at Monsanto and Rutgers University
<BR>
have been working with Scotts for several years to develop the new grass
<BR>
strains.
<BR>
<P>Activists are sabotaging test plots in protest. Last month, a group calling
<BR>
itself the Anarchist Golfing Association caused more than $300,000 worth of
<BR>
damage at an Oregon research center that was testing genetically altered
<BR>
grass for golf courses.
<BR>
<P>Scotts' products are not expected to reach the market for at least three
<BR>
years. But executives hope the company will reap enormous profits in a
<BR>
market they think could reach $10 billion.
<BR>
<P>However, the company will not use the word &quot;biotech&quot; on the labels. The word
<BR>
is generating negative feedback in consumer surveys. Instead, the company
<BR>
will call them &quot;superior plants,&quot; Berger said.
