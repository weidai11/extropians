<P>Outburst from a galaxy leaves scientists in a quandry
<BR>
<P>By Hazel Muir
<BR>
<P>ONE WEEK in 1997, a mouse of a galaxy between the shoulders of Hercules
<BR>
turned into a monster. &quot;It was rather inconspicuous before,&quot; says Heinz
<BR>
Vslk, who watched the action from the island of La Palma. &quot;But all of a
<BR>
sudden it became the strongest source we've ever seen.&quot;
<BR>
<P>This outburst from the galaxy Markarian 501 has left scientists in a
<BR>
quandary. The most energetic photons in the blast had trillions of times
<BR>
the energy of a visible photon, and according to the laws of physics as
<BR>
we understand them, they should never have made the vast journey from
<BR>
that galaxy to Earth. They should have been snuffed out by the sea of
<BR>
infrared radiation that fills space.
<BR>
<P>So what's going on? Some physicists think there's something weird
<BR>
happening inside Markarian 501: bunches of photons are ganging up 
<BR>
into exotic globs called Bose-Einstein condensates. 
<BR>
<P>Others say there'll be an everyday explanation once they've mulled 
<BR>
over the facts and figures a little more.
<BR>
<P>But some scientists think that Markarian 501 is telling us something
<BR>
momentous. It might, they say, go down in history as the key to a
<BR>
21st-century revolution, a theory that at last marries quantum mechanics
<BR>
with Einstein's theory of gravity. Then this galaxy would be a gateway
<BR>
to a hidden realm of nature where space and time are radically transformed.
<BR>
<P>Markarian 501 is no newcomer to astronomers. It appears on photos of the
<BR>
constellation Hercules dating back at least a century, and gets its
<BR>
name from Beniamin Markarian, a Georgian astronomer at the Byurakan
<BR>
Astrophysical Observatory in Armenia who started to compile a catalogue
<BR>
of hundreds of bluish galaxies in the 1960s.
<BR>
<P>Numbers 501 and 421 in his catalogue are special. At around 300 million
<BR>
light years away, they are the two closest examples to Earth of a rare
<BR>
and strange type of astronomical object known as a blazar. Like other
<BR>
kinds of active galaxy, such as quasars and radio galaxies, blazars are
<BR>
thought to be powered by a central black hole which feeds on the gas,
<BR>
dust and stars that whirl around it in a hot disc. Above and below the
<BR>
hole, two jets of energetic protons and electrons shoot millions of
<BR>
light years into space.
<BR>
<P>Blazars are capricious, flaring up and dimming again within just a few
<BR>
days. Astronomers think that this is because of their orientation. We
<BR>
see an active galaxy as a blazar if one of its jets is pointing towards us,
<BR>
as though we're looking down the barrel of a gun. The jet sends out a
<BR>
narrow beam of radiation whose brightness can change rapidly as it shifts
<BR>
slightly or its supply of material from the black hole changes.
<BR>
<P>This special alignment also means we are assailed with ferociously
<BR>
energetic radiation. In 1992, the orbiting Compton Gamma Ray Observatory 
<BR>
picked up high-energy gamma rays from Markarian 421. Astrophysicists 
<BR>
believe they are cooked up in the jet by superfast particles. As 
<BR>
electrons and protons spiral around the jet's strong magnetic fields, 
<BR>
they emit powerful radiation.
<BR>
<P>They could also be colliding with ordinary photons, boosting them to
<BR>
ultra-high energies.
<BR>
<P>But it wasn't until March 1997 that astronomers saw what a blazar can do
<BR>
when it really flexes its muscles. They watched astonished as Markarian
<BR>
501 flared up from one of the puniest gamma-ray sources in the sky to
<BR>
upstage even the Crab Nebula, the debris of an exploded star in our own
<BR>
galactic backyard, which is the brightest steady gamma source in the sky. 
<BR>
<P>The outburst lasted several months, and at its peak Markarian 501 was ten
<BR>
times as bright as the Crab, despite being 50 000 times farther away.
<BR>
&quot;The distance difference is just mind-blowing,&quot; says Vslk, a director at
<BR>
the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg.
<BR>
<P>Air shower
<BR>
<P>Vslk is a spokesman for an experiment called HEGRA (High Energy Gamma
<BR>
Ray Astronomy), which kept its eye on Markarian 501's storm from La Palma,
<BR>
in the Canary Islands. When a high-energy gamma ray hits the upper
<BR>
atmosphere, it sparks an &quot;air shower&quot; -- a spreading cascade of superfast 
<BR>
subatomic particles. These emit light, and because they move faster than 
<BR>
the speed of light in air their emissions pile up into blue flashes known 
<BR>
as Cerenkov radiation -- just as sound waves from supersonic aircraft 
<BR>
pile up into a sonic boom.
<BR>
<P>During 501's outburst, HEGRA's six big mirrors saw astoundingly bright
<BR>
blue flashes. These indicated that some of 501's gamma rays had energies 
<BR>
of up to 22 teraelectronvolts (Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol 349, p 11).
<BR>
<P>This is trillions of times as much as a photon of visible light, which 
<BR>
has an energy between 1 and 3 electronvolts.
<BR>
<P>What is hard to explain is why the gamma rays made it to Earth. When a
<BR>
high-energy gamma ray and an infrared photon collide, they have enough
<BR>
energy to mutate into an electron and a positron. So the gamma rays
<BR>
should be gradually mopped up by the sea of far-infrared photons that 
<BR>
fills space, emitted by forming stars and hot dust.
<BR>
<P>How far the gamma rays get depends on how many far-infrared photons are
<BR>
out there. In the past two years, several teams of scientists have taken 
<BR>
old images from NASA's Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite and the
<BR>
European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and used some
<BR>
novel mathematical tricks to cancel out the infrared from our own Solar 
<BR>
System and Galaxy. The results show that the far-infrared background is
<BR>
so bright that gamma rays with energies of more than 10 teraelectronvolts 
<BR>
should never reach the Earth from as far away as Markarian 501. So why 
<BR>
did we see them?
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the gamma rays are colluding against us, says Peter Biermann, an
<BR>
astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn.
<BR>
He and his colleagues suggest that several gamma rays from Markarian 501
<BR>
might merge into a Bose-Einstein condensate -- a densely packed globule 
<BR>
of lower-energy photons that have exactly the same positions.
<BR>
<P>This should happen to light from a super-efficient laser -- one far more
<BR>
efficient than any yet built on Earth. Nature does build lasers: in many
<BR>
active galaxies, X-rays make clouds of water vapour emit microwave laser
<BR>
light. The Universe is dotted with billions of these microwave lasers,
<BR>
or &quot;masers&quot;. But is a natural, super-efficient, ultra-high energy laser
<BR>
plausible? Biermann claims that it could conceivably happen when a group
<BR>
of excited atoms in a blazar's jet all stimulate each other to emit
<BR>
light at the same time (Astrophysical Journal Letters, vol 524, p 91). 
<BR>
<P>Say the blazar fired out a Bose-Einstein condensate of 20 identical
<BR>
gamma rays with energies of 1 teraelectronvolt each. Because these 
<BR>
photons have relatively low energy, they would be unimpeded by the 
<BR>
far-infrared background. Arriving together in the Earth's atmosphere, 
<BR>
they would dump 20 teraelectronvolts of energy at the same point in 
<BR>
the atmosphere, just like a single 20-teraelectronvolt gamma ray.
<BR>
<P>Scientists are now taking another look at HEGRA's observations to test
<BR>
this idea. They're looking for a subtle difference between the air showers 
<BR>
a high-energy photon would trigger in the atmosphere and those produced 
<BR>
by a ball of less energetic ones. Though they both have the same total
<BR>
energy, a lone high-energy photon would create a narrower, more chaotic 
<BR>
air shower.
<BR>
<P>&quot;It's like if you have a very heavy truck in a accident in the highway
<BR>
-- there's an incredible scatter.&quot; says Biermann. &quot;But 20 teeny trucks
<BR>
might do next to nothing.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Natural gamma-ray lasers may sound like an outlandish explanation, but
<BR>
another possibility would be far more momentous. Giovanni Amelino-Camelia,
<BR>
a physicist at the University of Rome, believes that Markarian 501's
<BR>
gamma rays might be subject to an entirely new kind of physics that 
<BR>
rules the high-energy world. For decades, physicists have been trying 
<BR>
to marry quantum theory with general relativity, Einstein's theory of 
<BR>
gravity. Most of their fledgling theories of quantum gravity predict 
<BR>
that on tiny scales, approaching 10**-35 metres, our picture of smooth 
<BR>
space and time falls apart, giving way to a seething froth of quantum 
<BR>
gravity fluctuations dubbed space-time foam.
<BR>
<P>If so, odd things start to happen. As photon energies get higher, the
<BR>
speed of light might start to drop off by a tiny amount, because the very
<BR>
short wavelength would mean that the light started to &quot;feel&quot; the bumpiness 
<BR>
of space-time. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;A very rough analogy is that if you roll a soccer ball across
<BR>
a table with lots of tiny ridges, it will travel at roughly the same
<BR>
speed it would have done if there were no ridges,&quot; says Amelino-Camelia. 
<BR>
&quot;But if you roll a tiny little ball, its path will be strongly altered 
<BR>
by all the little valleys in the table.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Feeling the bumps in space would not only slow very high-energy photons,
<BR>
it would help them avoid infrared photons. Raymond Protheroe of the
<BR>
University of Adelaide in South Australia and Hinrich Meyer of Wuppertal 
<BR>
University in Germany calculate that provided quantum gravity does indeed 
<BR>
kick in at a scale of 10**-35 metres, this could give 20-teraelectronvolt
<BR>
photons just the edge they need to ignore the far-infrared background and 
<BR>
make it from Markarian 501 to Earth.
<BR>
<P>What's most compelling, Amelino-Camelia says, is that this could also
<BR>
explain another cosmic conundrum. Protons with giant energies of more
<BR>
than 10**20 electronvolts are occasionally detected hitting our atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>For years, astrophysicists have wondered why. The only known sources that
<BR>
could produce such energy are distant active galaxies, which means that 
<BR>
these protons should also be eaten up by background radiation -- this 
<BR>
time the relic microwave radiation of the big bang (New Scientist, 7 
<BR>
December 1996, p 38).
<BR>
<P>According to calculations announced last month by Amelino-Camelia and
<BR>
Tsvi Piran of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the same roughness of
<BR>
space-time needed to explain the gamma rays from Markarian 501 also
<BR>
solves the cosmic ray problem. &quot;The remarkable point is that you have 
<BR>
these two problems at very different energy scales and contexts,&quot; says
<BR>
Amelino-Camelia.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Yet with the same equations, we can explain both.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Amelino-Camelia admits there's a lot of guesswork going on. But for the
<BR>
first time, he says, nature might be throwing us some solid clues to
<BR>
quantum gravity. &quot;And even if the correct explanation is different, we 
<BR>
are finally obtaining data that are relevant to our understanding of 
<BR>
the small-scale structure of space-time,&quot; says Amelino-Camelia. &quot;This 
<BR>
really is a turning point.&quot;
<BR>
<P>To find out if space-time is truly fuzzy in this way, Amelino-Camelia
<BR>
thinks astronomers should look to gamma-ray bursts. These are bright 
<BR>
bursts of gamma rays that appear unpredictably anywhere in the sky and 
<BR>
come from distant, mysterious sources. If astronomers could catch a very
<BR>
distant and bright burst, the highest-energy photons may lag slightly 
<BR>
behind (Nature, vol 393, p 763). He says present-day detectors aren't 
<BR>
sharp enough to pick up the tiny timing differences necessary. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;But on the space station and other orbiting observatories, we'll 
<BR>
acquire this level of sophistication over the next few years.&quot;
<BR>
<P>If Amelino-Camelia's speculations hold true, they could lead to a change
<BR>
in our concept of time as radical as that brought about by relativity at
<BR>
the beginning of the 20th century. &quot;Special relativity said that time is 
<BR>
not absolute. That was the breakthrough for mankind at that time,&quot; he says.
<BR>
<P>Quantum gravity implies that time comes in discrete pieces. What's more,
<BR>
like Schrsdinger's proverbial cat, which is neither dead nor alive until
<BR>
we choose to look at it, time would exist as a jumble of different possible
<BR>
values. &quot;The concept of 'now' becomes just a rough approximation,&quot; says
<BR>
Amelino-Camelia.
<BR>
<P>Not everyone agrees that Markarian 501's message is this radical.
<BR>
<P>&quot;That's a rather outré possibility,&quot; says Sheldon Glashow of Boston 
<BR>
University.
<BR>
<P>He believes that other experiments have made such large departures from
<BR>
smooth space-time look extremely unlikely, and thinks there's probably a
<BR>
simpler answer to the puzzle -- perhaps that we've overestimated the 
<BR>
distance to the blazar. If it is closer than we think, energetic gamma 
<BR>
rays could make the journey to Earth despite the infrared background.
<BR>
<P>Erasing the Milky Way
<BR>
<P>Biermann agrees that something mundane could turn out to be the key. &quot;My
<BR>
gut feeling is that the solution is something simple that we're just not
<BR>
seeing,&quot; he says. Along with Vslk, he'd put his money on the latest
<BR>
far-infrared measurements being wrong. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The measurement of the far-infrared background is notoriously difficult,&quot;
<BR>
says Biermann. He thinks that improved tricks for erasing the Milky Way 
<BR>
from COBE and ISO images to work out the strength of the far-infrared 
<BR>
background might show it to be weaker than we now think.
<BR>
<P>One way to resolve this would be to look at more distant blazars. A
<BR>
whole new generation of gamma-ray telescopes is due to get under way.
<BR>
<P>Scientists from Germany, France and Italy are building a telescope array 
<BR>
in Namibia called HESS (High Energy Stereoscopic System). The array, with 
<BR>
up to 16 telescopes, will be 10 times as sensitive as HEGRA, and could 
<BR>
pick up blazars 30 times as distant as Markarian 501.
<BR>
<P>The first four HESS telescopes should start operating next year, along
<BR>
with a German telescope called MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging
<BR>
Cerenkov Telescope). MAGIC, at the HEGRA site on La Palma, will gather 
<BR>
Cerenkov light using a mirror 17 metres across. Further down the line, 
<BR>
there are plans for an American telescope called VERITAS (Very Energetic 
<BR>
Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System). Sited at the foot of Mount 
<BR>
Hopkins in Arizona, this array will have seven mirrors, each 10.4 metres
<BR>
across, and start operating sometime in 2004 or later.
<BR>
<P>If the new telescopes find that Markarian 501's even more distant
<BR>
cousins are relentlessly pelting us with 20-teraelectronvolt gamma rays,
<BR>
ordinary physics will be hard pushed to explain why. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;This would deepen the suspicion that something dramatically new is 
<BR>
happening,&quot; says Meyer. 
<BR>
<P>Whatever happens, the performance of the Universe's most histrionic 
<BR>
galaxies will be under the spotlight for years to come.
