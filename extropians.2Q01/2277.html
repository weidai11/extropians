<p>FBI's Reliance on the Private Sector
<br>
Has Raised Some Privacy Concerns
<br>
<p>By GLENN R. SIMPSON
<br>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
<br>
<p><p>WASHINGTON -- Big Brother isn't gone. He's just been outsourced.
<br>
<p>After surveillance scandals in the 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Bureau
<br>
of
<br>
Investigation and other federal law-enforcement authorities curbed their
<br>
file-keeping on U.S. citizens. But in the past several years, the FBI,
<br>
the
<br>
Internal Revenue Service and other agencies have started buying troves
<br>
of
<br>
personal data from the private sector.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From their desktop computers, 20,000 agents at the IRS have access to
</em><br>
outside data on taxpayers' assets, driving histories, phone numbers and
<br>
other personal statistics. Using a password, FBI agents can log on to a
<br>
custom Web page that links them with privately owned files on tens of
<br>
millions of Americans. And with just a few keystrokes, the U.S. Marshals
<br>
Service can find out if a fugitive has recently rented a mailbox or
<br>
acquired a new phone line.
<br>
<p>'An End Run'
<br>
<p>Behind such high-tech tools are ChoicePoint Inc., a publicly held
<br>
Alpharetta, Ga., company and other commercial &quot;look-up&quot; services.
<br>
ChoicePoint and its rivals specialize in doing what the law discourages
<br>
the
<br>
government from doing on its own -- culling, sorting and packaging data
<br>
on
<br>
individuals from scores of sources, including credit bureaus, marketers
<br>
and
<br>
regulatory agencies.
<br>
<p>Privacy activists say that by outsourcing these tasks, federal agencies
<br>
are
<br>
violating at least the spirit of the nation's major privacy law, which
<br>
admonishes the agencies to maintain only the data about a given
<br>
individual
<br>
that they need to do their jobs. &quot;It's simply an end run around the
<br>
Privacy
<br>
Act&quot; of 1974, says Marc Rotenberg a lawyer for the Electronic Privacy
<br>
Information Center, an advocacy group based here.
<br>
<p>Back in the 1970s, critics say, lawmakers never imagined that technology
<br>
would place so much data within the government's reach but outside its
<br>
actual possession. They add that the government's alliances with
<br>
ChoicePoint and its peers have evolved largely without debate or
<br>
congressional oversight at a time of increasing public concern about
<br>
online
<br>
threats to privacy.
<br>
<p>ChoicePoint and its federal clients say their use of the company's data
<br>
follows both the letter and spirit of the law. And, indeed, there has
<br>
been
<br>
little evidence so far of privacy violations arising from government
<br>
access
<br>
to the data. &quot;We are only permitted to obtain evidence and information
<br>
consistent with applicable laws, including the Privacy Act, and rigorous
<br>
attorney general guidelines,&quot; says FBI spokesman John Collingwood. &quot;A
<br>
vigorous inspection process, judicial oversight of prosecuted cases and
<br>
civil remedies are in place to enforce compliance by FBI employees.&quot;
<br>
<p>ChoicePoint Chief Executive Derek Smith calls his company's dealings
<br>
with
<br>
the government &quot;a natural extension&quot; of its business of equipping
<br>
insurers
<br>
and other companies to check out prospective partners and clients.
<br>
Similarly, he says, the company helps the government find criminals and
<br>
uncover fraud that hurts taxpayers.
<br>
<p>Mr. Smith says his company's contracts define appropriate uses of its
<br>
data
<br>
and that ChoicePoint audits them to make sure those conditions are met.
<br>
&quot;I
<br>
care very much about making sure the information is used to make a
<br>
safer,
<br>
more secure society,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>Federal agencies contract with several private-sector companies for data
<br>
and related services. Among them is Lexis-Nexis, a unit of Anglo-Dutch
<br>
publisher Reed-Elsevier PLC, whose databases include newspaper articles,
<br>
legal briefs and other public records. But ChoicePoint is the biggest
<br>
supplier to law enforcement.
<br>
<p>The FBI's Investigative Information Services unit, which helps agents
<br>
obtain information on individuals for their investigations, relies
<br>
heavily
<br>
on ChoicePoint's services. On the Web, FBI agents also can go to
<br>
www.cpfbi.com1 -- &quot;ChoicePoint Online for the FBI&quot; -- for help in
<br>
conducting their own searches. On that Web page, the company's logo
<br>
appears
<br>
alongside the FBI's official seal.
<br>
<p>&quot;The FBI has located nearly 1,300 subjects of criminal cases using these
<br>
kinds of searches,&quot; Mr. Collingwood says. The service &quot;saves countless
<br>
hours of manual records checks, a process the FBI has relied on for
<br>
decades.&quot; Neither the FBI nor ChoicePoint would disclose how much the
<br>
agency pays the company.
<br>
<p>The Justice Department's contract with ChoicePoint ballooned to $8
<br>
million
<br>
last year from $1 million in 1996. Treasury Department documents show
<br>
that
<br>
the exclusive multiyear deal the IRS signed with the company in August
<br>
is
<br>
worth a total of $8 million to $12 million. The company says its clients
<br>
include at least 35 federal agencies.
<br>
<p>That business has contributed to ChoicePoint's impressive financial
<br>
performance. Since it became a standalone company four years ago,
<br>
ChoicePoint's stock price has more than doubled. Thursday in 4 p.m. New
<br>
York Stock Exchange composite trading, its shares rose 65 cents to
<br>
$35.50,
<br>
down from its 52-week high of $44.67 in December. Last year,
<br>
ChoicePoint's
<br>
business and government division had revenue of $292.4 million, up 24%
<br>
from
<br>
1999, and its operating income more than tripled to $45.3 million. The
<br>
division now accounts for more than half the company's total revenue.
<br>
<p>ChoicePoint says it buys its primary information for the data products
<br>
it
<br>
markets to the government, private detectives and the media from the
<br>
nation's three major credit bureaus. They are Equifax Credit Information
<br>
Services Inc., a unit of former ChoicePoint parent Equifax Inc.; Trans
<br>
Union LLC and Experian Information Solutions Inc. Each of the three
<br>
companies maintains credit histories on more than 180 million Americans.
<br>
<p>The company takes these credit-bureau files and retains the portion that
<br>
lists the consumer's name, known aliases, birthdate, Social Security
<br>
number, current and prior addresses and phone number. The credit-bureaus
<br>
are valuable sources of such data because their records tend to be
<br>
up-to-
<br>
date. That's because people typically tell their creditors when they
<br>
move,
<br>
even if they fail to tell the Postal Service.
<br>
<p>ChoicePoint indexes this data under the subject's Social Security number
<br>
and stirs in more information it gleans from other sources. These
<br>
sources,
<br>
including local, state and federal agencies, sell the company data
<br>
ranging
<br>
from motor-vehicle, driver and boat registrations, liens and deed
<br>
transfers
<br>
to phone listings, military personnel records and voter rolls.
<br>
<p>By mixing and matching its databases, ChoicePoint can accumulate all
<br>
kinds
<br>
of information -- a speeding fine, a bankruptcy filing, a spouse's name
<br>
<pre>
--
under a single Social Security number, tailoring the data and related
software to a particular client. However, the company has warned
investors
that its ability to do business would suffer if Congress were to enact
laws
restricting the private use of Social Security numbers, as has been
proposed in recent years.
<p>Address Inspector
<p>The Health Care Financing Administration uses the company's Address
Inspector software to help identify fraudulent Medicare claims. The
product
lets it check health-care providers' addresses against two million of
what
ChoicePoint calls &quot;high-risk and fraudulent business addresses.&quot; They
include private mailboxes and street addresses in high-crime areas.
Thoughmany who rent private mailboxes do so out of concern for their
privacy, those box numbers still can end up in ChoicePoint's hands if
they
are used in dealings with businesses or government.
<p>Although ChoicePoint says it has records on nearly every American with a
credit card, it doesn't always provide access to that data. The
company's
Autotrack service is popular with many agencies and businesses and is
also
used by reporters at The Wall Street Journal. But entering the name of
FBI
Director Louis Freeh into the Autotrack database produces an error
message.
A company spokesman says ChoicePoint intentionally blocks Mr. Freeh's
records as an act of good corporate citizenship.
<p>Among the tools ChoicePoint offers law-enforcement agencies is the
ability
to set up &quot;alert&quot; files that continuously scan databases for information
on
a suspect. So far, the U.S. Marshals Service, which has a $3.8 million
contract with ChoicePoint, is the only agency that uses this feature. In
1999, one such alert showed that a woman wanted for mail fraud had
rented a
private mailbox. A follow-up investigation led to her arrest, according
to
agency records.
<p>While they decline to discuss details of their relationship with
ChoicePoint, the FBI and other agencies say they aren't doing anything
new
except retrieving data electronically instead of digging through various
far-flung paper files. Before ChoicePoint, &quot;We went all over the place
going to the same sources of information as ChoicePoint is going to,&quot;
says
Greg Gagne, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
which paid the company $1.5 million last year.
<p>Three decades ago, revelations about the FBI's history of compiling
files
on Vietnam War protesters, civil-rights activists, celebrities and
thousands of other citizens seemingly picked at random set off a wave of
public outrage. Among those with files were Albert Einstein, Rock
Hudson,
Cesar Chavez and Henry Ford.
<p>Congress responded by passing the Privacy Act of 1974, which was
designed
to discourage such wholesale data gathering. While the law doesn't
explicitly prohibit the government from compiling dossiers on presumably
law-abiding private citizens, the FBI and other agencies in the past
have
generally interpreted it that way. Moreover, some of those agencies' own
internal guidelines bar them from actively assembling such files
themselves.
<p>For instance, the FBI's &quot;Manual of Investigations, Operations and
Guidelines&quot; says, &quot;Only that information about an individual which is
relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose authorized by statute,
executive order of the president, or by the Constitution is to be
recorded
in FBI files.&quot;
<p>Scott Charney, former head prosecutor in the Justice Department's
computer
crime unit, says department guidelines prohibit the collection of public
or
other data on an individual unless the agency has reason to believe he
may
have committed a crime. &quot;If the government can't go out and collect
information on you absent predication, they shouldn't be able to go out&quot;
and buy it from an outside source, says Mr. Charney, now a lawyer for
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC.
<p>Indeed, some attorneys think the government's reliance on outside data
collectors may violate citizens' rights to protection against
unreasonable
searches. Gerry Goldstein, a criminal defense lawyer in San Antonio,
says
that, &quot;When the government actively encourages and solicits individuals
to
act on their behalf, those individuals,&quot; in effect, become government
agents.
<p>Mr. Gagne of the INS dismisses that argument. The government, he says,
didn't solicit ChoicePoint or other data providers to build their
databases. &quot;They were doing this for quite some time&quot; before the
government
started buying the data, he says.
<p>Another concern cited by critics is that Uncle Sam historically has
proved
to be an unreliable safekeeper of private information. In 1993, an
inquiry
by the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, found
that
the FBI's own audits had repeatedly reported misuse of the agency's
biggest
internal database, the National Crime Information Center. Last year, the
GAO said the federal government wasn't complying with privacy standards
the
Federal Trade Commission had proposed for businesses. And a recent House
investigation gave the government's computer-security efforts a
&quot;D-minus&quot;
grade.
<p>Moreover, the public data ChoicePoint and its rivals use to build their
databases aren't always accurate -- as ChoicePoint itself has found.
<p>Florida Lawsuit
<p>In January, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People
sued ChoicePoint and the state of Florida in federal court in Miami,
accusing the company of supplying faulty data that led to thousands of
citizens being wrongly purged from Florida voter rolls in the November
election. ChoicePoint has admitted that some data it provided was
inaccurate, but it says its DBT Online Inc. unit, which was hired by the
state to compile lists of convicted felons still carried on the rolls,
warned state officials that the data needed to be verified. Florida
election officials have blamed their predecessors and county authorities
for not following through.
<p>In another incident, this time in the private sector, a Chicago-area
woman
was fired in 1998 from her technical job at a major computer maker after
ChoicePoint told her employer that she was a convicted drug dealer and
shoplifter. In fact, the woman had no criminal record. A ChoicePoint
spokesman concedes the mistake. The woman's employer rehired her, but in
a
menial job. She sued both companies and reached a confidential
settlement.
<p>Until four years ago, ChoicePoint was part of Atlanta-based Equifax.
Like
other credit bureaus, Equifax's collection and sale of personal data on
American consumers has been dogged by controversy over the years,
leading
regulators to put stricter rules on the companies' practices.
<p>In 1993, Mr. Smith took the helm of Equifax's insurance-services
division,
which helped insurers evaluate the risks of taking on new policyholders.
He
says he quickly realized that the money-losing unit could serve another,
potentially lucrative purpose. With society becoming more mobile, he
says,
he decided to pitch the division's database as a way for companies to
feel
more secure in dealing with relative strangers. The division's fortunes
rebounded, with its operating income tripling in 1994. Equifax spun the
division off in 1997, and Mr. Smith went along as CEO.
<p>Meanwhile, the FBI and others started to appreciate the value of
computerized databases and looking to the private sector for help in
gathering records. Two companies, CDB Infotek and DBT, won much of this
early business, because of their experience selling data to police
departments.
<p>ChoicePoint acquired CDB Infotek in 1996 and purchased DBT last year. It
also bought up more than a dozen other firms that bought police reports
and
records relating to drug tests, physicians' backgrounds, insurance
fraud,
and litigation. DBT brought in the biggest haul. The data DBT had
collected
from insurers, private eyes, law firms and government doubled
ChoicePoint's
data bank to 10 billion records.
