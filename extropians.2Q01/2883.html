a hot air balloon!  Followed by a blimp, then airliners, then

something like an aerobatic plane.

<p>The hotdog fighter jock is free to play, but ultimately in

<p>AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE CHINA RESCUE MISSION April 12, 2001
<br>
<p>By Captain Guy Greider Continental Airlines
<br>
<p>Since the mid-air collision on April 1, 2001 between a U.S.
<br>
NavyEP-3 surveillance aircraft and a Chinese jet fighter,
<br>
I had watched thenews with mild interest. This was mostly
<br>
due to the proximity of Guam toChina.  I never dreamed that
<br>
I would play a role in this intensely watchedinternational
<br>
drama. Somewhere in the negotiations between theUnited
<br>
States and the Chinese Governments, it was decided that
<br>
a civilian aircraft should be sent to retrieve the 24
<br>
crewmembers being detained on Hainan Island, China. A
<br>
call was made to Continental Airlines headquarters in
<br>
Houston, Texas. Continental was chosen because of its
<br>
Guam base and its ability to launch this kind of
<br>
operation at a moment s notice. From there, the
<br>
operation took shape through the tireless efforts of
<br>
many people workingbehind the scenes in a coordinated
<br>
effort between the airline, the military,and the State
<br>
Department.
<br>
<p>On Saturday, April 7, 2001, I received a
<br>
call athome from Captain Ralph Freeman, Continental
<br>
Micronesia Director of FlightOperations. Ralph told
<br>
me that the military wanted to charter one of ourjets
<br>
to conduct a rescue mission and asked if I would be
<br>
one of thecrewmembers. I said yes without hesitation.
<br>
<p>Later we were told that we would need to get passport
<br>
pictures taken in case the Chinese Government required
<br>
visas. We got the required photos and were under the
<br>
impression that wewould leave immediately. However,
<br>
the negotiations slowed over the demandfrom the
<br>
Chinese that the U.S. issue an apology that the
<br>
U.S. was unwillingto give. Meanwhile, the Continental
<br>
crew remained on call 24 hours a day.Our Uniforms
<br>
were laid out and our bags were packed and waiting
<br>
by the door.
<br>
<p>On Wednesday evening April 11, 2001,
<br>
at about 630 PM Ralph called again tosay that the
<br>
two parties were very close to an agreement to
<br>
release the U.S.crew and to come to the airport.
<br>
<p>Upon arrival, we were given a briefingsheet listing
<br>
the information that we would need to conduct the
<br>
flight. Wewould carry a Repatriation Team consisting
<br>
of Navy, Marine Corps, and AirForce specialists,
<br>
14 people in all. Doctors, Psychologists, and
<br>
communications people with lots of gear showed up
<br>
on the ramp near theairplane, ready to board. They
<br>
were all dressed in casual civilian clothes.
<br>
<p>The 155-seat jet was fitted with 2 full stretcher kits
<br>
bolted in over rowsof seats complete with Oxygen
<br>
tanks and I.V. bottles. They did not know the
<br>
condition of the24 detained crewmembers and they
<br>
were not going to take any chances. Theywere
<br>
prepared. When our crew was fully assembled, it
<br>
consisted of 11 people.2 pilots to fly the jet
<br>
and an extra to provide relief because of the
<br>
extensive flight time involved. They were Captain
<br>
Tom Pinardo, CaptainPierre Frenay and I. We also
<br>
carried 5 very experienced Flight Attendants.They
<br>
were Debbie Percell, Susanne Hendricks, Jean Tang,
<br>
Cynthia Iverson, andBeverly Haines. Our 2 onboard
<br>
mechanics were Peter Lum and Julius Aguilo. Our
<br>
load planner was Mike Torres.
<br>
<p>At about 930 PM we
<br>
received a call askingthat we arrive in China no
<br>
earlier than 600 AM, just about sunrise. It was
<br>
obvious that the entire exchange would be
<br>
photographed and they wanteddaylight conditions.
<br>
We estimated that a 215 AM departure from Guam
<br>
wouldput us on the ground in Haikou precisely
<br>
at 600 AM local China time. (2hours earlier than
<br>
Guam) Some of us just stayed on the plane, other
<br>
saccepted the company s invitation to come to the
<br>
Continental President sClub, a local VIP lounge at
<br>
the airport to try to get some rest.
<br>
<p>It was difficult
<br>
to get any rest with our much-anticipated mission
<br>
so near. By 100AM the pilots were back in the
<br>
briefing room going over the weather, flightplan,
<br>
fuel requirements and everything else that goes
<br>
into a flight. Again,we loaded up the airplane and
<br>
finally departed Guam International atprecisely 215
<br>
AM. The stretcher kits and medical gear were not
<br>
the onlyspecial additions to the airplane. The company
<br>
had loaded a special file into the navigation
<br>
database of the flight management computer (FMC).
<br>
This allowed us to gain access to navigation data
<br>
needed to operate in this partof China, which is
<br>
not in our normal route structure.
<br>
<p>The Repatriation
<br>
Team carried sophisticated equipment to communicate
<br>
with the military andgovernment officials that would
<br>
monitor our progress throughout the flight.The
<br>
route of flight took us straight west from Guam
<br>
toward the Philippinesalong the G467 airway. About
<br>
half way across we turned north directly toward
<br>
Hong Kong. This routing was designed to avoid
<br>
flying through Taiwaneseairspace, something that
<br>
the Chinese could consider offensive.
<br>
<p>Approaching
<br>
the Chinese coastline, we contacted Hong Kong
<br>
radar control. After establishing radar contact
<br>
with us, the controller gave us a short cut  to
<br>
expedite his traffic flow. This was bad because
<br>
it cut off considerabledistance and would result
<br>
in arriving too early. We compensated by slowing
<br>
our airspeed until the computer again estimated
<br>
a 600 AM arrival. Theinstant we turned across
<br>
the short cut, the interphone rang from the back of
<br>
the plane. They wanted to know why we had deviated
<br>
from the flight plan. Wetold them it was due to
<br>
Hong Kong traffic and that we had adjusted our
<br>
airspeed. We were still on schedule. Now we were
<br>
approaching our destination, Haikou airport on
<br>
Hainan Island. Captain Pierre Frenay was atthe
<br>
controls.
<br>
<p>The weather was 2000-ft overcast with
<br>
5 miles visibility andlight winds out of the east.
<br>
Pierre made an ILS approach to and landed onrunway 9.
<br>
Haikou airport is much the same as many other
<br>
airports in theworld that serve jet transport
<br>
aircraft. It has an 11,000-ft runway withstandard
<br>
lighting and navigational facilities. We touched
<br>
down at 607 AM.The first early morning light was
<br>
beginning to illuminate the sky. The localair
<br>
traffic controller instructed us to follow a
<br>
vehicle that was beside uson an adjacent taxiway.
<br>
He led us to a remote part of the airport, away
<br>
fromthe main terminal buildings.
<br>
<p>Once we had
<br>
parked and shut down the engines,we saw many
<br>
uniformed Chinese military personnel and vehicles.
<br>
They did notappear to have weapons. Portable
<br>
stairs were brought up to the airplane and we
<br>
opened the main cabin door. The Repatriation
<br>
Team that we carried hadbeen briefed to close
<br>
down all of their communications equipment prior
<br>
tolanding and put it away. They were also briefed
<br>
to remain in their seats ina non-threatening
<br>
posture in case the Chinese military came aboard.
<br>
<p>Thefirst and only person to come aboard was an
<br>
Air China employee. He spokeEnglish and was to
<br>
act as the translator between our group and the
<br>
Chinese military. He instructed us to have everyone
<br>
fill out both arrival anddeparture documents.
<br>
He collected all of our passports and left the
<br>
aircraft. Before he left, he said that only one
<br>
person at a time would beallowed to deplane. Peter
<br>
Lum, one of our mechanics went down to supervise
<br>
the re-fueling and servicing of the airplane. When
<br>
that was complete, I wentdown to do the walk-around
<br>
inspection. I did this rather slowly because I
<br>
wanted to have a chance to look around.
<br>
<p>While I
<br>
was out on the ramp, a skirmish developed between
<br>
people who were trying to climb a wall to photograph
<br>
our aircraft and the Chinese police. Somehow, CNN
<br>
managed tocarry our arrival and departure live.
<br>
Once the airplane was serviced andready to go, we
<br>
looked anxiously around for any sign of the buses
<br>
thatcarried our 24 detainees. Before that could
<br>
happen however, we had a problemto deal with. A  U.S.
<br>
military General who was on the scene to assist in
<br>
thetransfer came storming up the stairs and demanded
<br>
to speak with the Captain.Tom Pinardo responded. The
<br>
General said that the entire mission was now in
<br>
jeopardy. A document called the general declaration,
<br>
which is standard onall international flights had
<br>
listed the destination as Haikou, China R.O.C.The
<br>
initials ROC stand for Republic of China which is ...
<br>
Taiwan! The Chinesewere very upset over this. Tom
<br>
quickly crossed out ROC and replaced it with P.R.O.C.
<br>
the Peoples Republic of China. This seemed to satisfy
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Withthe airplane ready to go and the paperwork
<br>
complete,2 buses pulled up and the 24 U.S. service
<br>
men and women saluted as theybolted up the stairs and
<br>
settled into the back of the plane. When the lastone
<br>
was aboard, our passports were returned to us. The
<br>
stairs werewithdrawn, the cabin door closed, and we
<br>
started the engines and departed.It was my turn at
<br>
the controls. Once airborne heading straight south
<br>
we broke through the clouds into the bright sunshine.
<br>
&nbsp;Pierre made a PA announcement that we were over
<br>
international waters and leaving Chinese airspace.
<br>
A great cheer rose from the back of the airplane.
<br>
<p>A short whilelater we received a telephone patch over
<br>
the HF radio from Mr. JosephPrueher, U.S Ambassador
<br>
to China. He wanted to speak with Lt. Shane Osborne
<br>
the 26 year old EP-3 Aircraft Commander. Lt. Osborne
<br>
came to the cockpit andput on a headset. The Ambassador
<br>
told him that on behalf of the President ofthe United
<br>
States and the entire country he wanted to say welcome
<br>
&nbsp;home . Hewent on to say how proud he was of everything
<br>
&nbsp;the crew had done from theirairmanship in saving the
<br>
&nbsp;lives of the crew and aircraft, to their conduct on
<br>
the ground once they had been detained. They had
<br>
truly done an excellentjob.
<br>
<p>After his conversation
<br>
with the Ambassador, Lt. Osborne stayed in the
<br>
cockpit for quite a while and told us his story
<br>
pilot to pilot of what hadhappened during and
<br>
immediately after the mid-air collision with the
<br>
F-8 Chinese fighter. The fighter came up under their
<br>
&nbsp;left wing. This pilot made2 very close passes
<br>
previously that day. He apparently misjudged the
<br>
intercept and his vertical stabilizer struck the
<br>
outboard left propeller onthe EP-3. The U.S. plane
<br>
&nbsp;was in straight and level flight on autopilot at
<br>
the time. The fighter broke into two pieces and
<br>
plunged into the sea. TheU.S. plane rolled to the
<br>
left almost inverted, the pilot lost control and
<br>
they began to lose altitude. The Chinese fighter
<br>
had raked back across thefuselage and knocked off
<br>
the nose cone causing the aircraft to buffet wildly.
<br>
When the nose cone departed the aircraft it collided
<br>
with anddamaged the number 4 propeller on the right
<br>
wing. The collision puncturedthe pressure vessel and
<br>
&nbsp;the EP-3 depressurized. The collision also knocked
<br>
off the pitot tubes eliminating airspeed and altitude
<br>
&nbsp;indications in thecockpit. It also knocked off the
<br>
&nbsp;forward bracket for the HF radio antenna.The antenna
<br>
&nbsp;then flew back and wrapped around the tail.
<br>
<p>We were
<br>
&nbsp;almostupside down and totally out of control Osborne
<br>
&nbsp;told us. The dive continuedand some crew members
<br>
donned parachutes. At about 8,000 feet, Osborne
<br>
regained straight and level flight. They considered
<br>
ditching the aircraft inthe South China Sea but
<br>
dismissed that option because it was certain to
<br>
result in loss of life. They headed for the nearest
<br>
&nbsp;land, Hainan Island. TheU.S. crew now faced the
<br>
most difficult landing of their lives. They made
<br>
numerous mayday, mayday, mayday radio calls on
<br>
internationally recognizedemergency frequencies.
<br>
The Chinese did not respond. Somehow, they managed to
<br>
get the airplane on the ground.
<br>
<p>Their next immediate
<br>
&nbsp;task was to destroy thesensitive electronic
<br>
surveillance equipment aboard the EP-3. Meanwhile
<br>
&nbsp;the Chinese military had approached the aircraft
<br>
&nbsp;in vehicles and were yelling atthem through
<br>
loudspeakers to deplane. The next 11 days would
<br>
be a veryuncertain time for them. When we met
<br>
them, they told us that they had notbeen abused
<br>
&nbsp;or mistreated. Their food was adequate and
<br>
plentiful. Sort oflike eating in a Chinese
<br>
restaurant every day one of them said.
<br>
<p>On the forth
<br>
day, they got some coffee. On the fifth day, some
<br>
&nbsp;cokes were provided. Thecrew did not know what
<br>
kind of transport would be provided for their return
<br>
home. They were pleased and surprised to see a
<br>
chartered airliner from theUnited States. The rest
<br>
&nbsp;of the flight from Haikou to Anderson AFB on Guam
<br>
was uneventful. During the 5 hour flight the crew
<br>
was treated to the movieMen of Honor and enjoyed
<br>
a first class meal. We did not know it at the time
<br>
but our landing at Anderson AFB was carried live
<br>
on national television. Wetaxied to the parking
<br>
ramp at Anderson where many people had turned out
<br>
&nbsp;to welcome all of us home. Individuals and
<br>
families with kids, both militaryand civilian
<br>
waved American flags and cheered, showing
<br>
support for thereturning U.S. spy plane crew.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Once the 24 U.S. crewmembers and the military
<br>
Repatriation Team had deplaned at Anderson,
<br>
they immediately boarded waitingbuses and were
<br>
&nbsp;whisked away. The Continental crew then became
<br>
&nbsp;the object ofintense media attention. CNN,
<br>
MSNBC, ABC, NBC, Reuters and various print
<br>
media interviewed us. A dizzying swirl of
<br>
attention after a very long day.We were happy,
<br>
tired, and pleased that the mission was so
<br>
successful as Tomflew the last segment, a
<br>
10-minute flight back to Guam International
<br>
Airport. This time our passengers included
<br>
Bill Meehan, President ofContinental Micronesia,
<br>
&nbsp;Guam Governor Carl Gutierrez, Lieutenant Governor
<br>
Bordallo and others.
<br>
<p>We thought the day was
<br>
just about over but we had onemore surprise
<br>
in store. After landing, we were given a hero s
<br>
welcome of ourown. The airport fire department
<br>
was in place to give us the traditionalwater
<br>
cannon salute, a rainbow arch of water for us
<br>
to taxi under. Areception was held at the gate
<br>
&nbsp;with food, balloons, commemorative plaques,and
<br>
&nbsp;more media interviews with the local television
<br>
&nbsp;station. This was veryheady stuff.
<br>
<p>As I look
<br>
back on this one of a kind operation. It could not
<br>
have happened without the tremendous effort and
<br>
skills of many peopleworking behind the scenes.
<br>
Bill Meehan, Mitch Dubner at the SOCC in Houston,
<br>
Tom Rinow at the CMI SOCC, Captain Ralph Freeman,
<br>
CMI Director of FlightOperations, and many others
<br>
&nbsp;had major rolls in coordinating this flight.
<br>
Itwas accomplished through teamwork. The fact
<br>
&nbsp;that it came off without a hitchis testimony
<br>
to how well all these people did their jobs.
<br>
The exposure thatContinental Airlines received
<br>
over this is a marketing manager s dream comes
<br>
true. We will be remembered by millions of
<br>
people as the company whoconducted the China
<br>
Rescue Mission . This was a proud day for
<br>
ContinentalAirlines and for America.    –
