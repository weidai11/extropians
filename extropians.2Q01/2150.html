A typically Gatesian move would be to publicly espouse the luddite meme,
<br>
while working to undermine it from within, which would invite lawsuits
<br>
from both Larry Ellison on one side, and Bill Joy on the other...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seattle Times technology reporter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An upcoming Microsoft system will use cameras and microphones to tell if a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; user is facing the computer or talking, so it will know whether it can deliver
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a message or a call.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As if an antitrust battle wasn't enough, Microsoft has thrust itself into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growing national debate over online privacy with its new Internet-services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initiative, code-named HailStorm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft is betting consumers will be willing to disclose more personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in coming years, in return for HailStorm's ability to simplify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; online shopping, collaborating and communicating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Financial analysts say Microsoft may be the only company in the world with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skill and clout to pull it off, but privacy and security experts say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company may be overestimating how much information the public is willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This is sort of what defines you as an individual and I think there's some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real issues there about giving some company control of that data,&quot; said Mark
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy group in Washington, D.C.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Craig Mundie, the Microsoft senior vice president helping Chairman Bill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gates develop future strategies, contended that people were also reluctant to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use credit cards at first because of privacy concerns, and now the cards are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ubiquitous because they make life easier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mundie said the public will fully accept the HailStorm concept and Microsoft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a trusted repository within five to 10 years. &quot;They'll trade off aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal information in order to get a benefit,&quot; he said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gates presented HailStorm on March 19 as the cornerstone of a new generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Internet services Microsoft will offer starting next year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Initially, HailStorm will consist of a universal password and a service that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would deliver short text messages to computers, pagers, phones and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices. It would also automatically coordinate appointment calendars and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; store personal files online.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eventually, the service will be able to watch and listen to computer users in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their homes and offices, so it knows when they are busy and when to interrupt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them with important messages and calls.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft researcher Eric Horvitz, who demonstrated the seeing and listening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;notification platform&quot; at a conference in Seattle last week, said it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;inform the notification manager as to how best to get information to you in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right time and the right place.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basic HailStorm services, including an expanded version of Microsoft's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Passport authentication service, will be free when they become available next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year. Services such as automatic message delivery and calendar management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be available for perhaps $20 to $50 per year.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HailStorm would ultimately act as an online super secretary, arranging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appointments, filing documents, reminding the boss of a relative's birthday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and even helping buy and ship an appropriate gift.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are in a car accident, HailStorm could automatically send your medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history and insurance information to the hospital before the ambulance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrived. Then it could page your spouse and reschedule your appointments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But for HailStorm to do its job to the fullest, users would have to entrust
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft with all kinds of personal information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Already people share some personal information with their bank, other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information with their doctor and still other information with friends and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; family. But most people don't give all that data to a central registry like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HailStorm, said privacy advocate Rotenberg.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;One of the ways we protect our privacy is by disclosing some of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in some contexts and not in others, and it's in that selective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disclosure of information that you establish bonds of trust and friendship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with friends and family members and others,&quot; he said. &quot;Sitting in the hub of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those relationships is the actual individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;What Microsoft seems to be doing here is saying, `Sure there's an individual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we can effectively map those data flows and extract them from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual and replicate them on a case-by-case basis,' and that's where I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think some substantial privacy issues arise.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another concern for some is Microsoft's ability to protect that data. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; announcing the service last month, Microsoft officials acknowledged the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; company has been vulnerable to attacks and system failures, but it also runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the world's busiest Web sites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Now, being honest, some of that experience is very good and some of it's not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so good,&quot; said Bob Muglia, the group vice president overseeing technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development of the services. &quot;But we're committed to taking and learning from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mistakes that we've made, such as the outage we had in January, to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure that we put in place the infrastructure so that we can run these things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with extremely high degrees of availability.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still, having a single company in control of so much information makes some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security experts leery of HailStorm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Centralizing data creates a target for attacks, especially if it's Microsoft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing the centralizing, said Richard Stiennon, security-research director for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gartner, a Stamford, Conn.-based consulting company that advises 60 percent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Fortune 500 companies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;They're the most attacked infrastructure there is on the Internet, they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the No. 1 target for hackers,&quot; he said. &quot;For Microsoft to take the step of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a centralized repository of information, a login or whatever it is, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something that Gartner clients won't be advised to do.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Privacy and security concerns aside, Microsoft should have no problem creating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sophisticated network upon which HailStorm will operate, said Giga
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Information Group analyst Rob Enderle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Their image as a secure and trusted provider of this service is probably the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biggest Achilles heel,&quot; he said. &quot;The second is the fee.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Enderle said Microsoft may overcome privacy concerns by partnering with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trusted institution, such as Citibank, Visa or MasterCard, or perhaps even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. Postal Service.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sooner or later, Enderle expects services such as HailStorm will drive the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next wave of Internet commerce by providing a more personalized experience for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the consumer. And Microsoft could make it work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;They're probably one of the only companies that can pull together the mass of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources, whether that be software development tools or platforms, to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an overall integrated solution among messaging, customer information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; e-commerce that would be required to really change the Internet market,&quot; he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another hurdle may be Congress, where concern about online privacy has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prompted several proposed laws that could restrict the collection and use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal information. A spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy and Internet taxation are top priorities for his Commerce, Science and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Transportation Committee. McCain and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., are planning a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; privacy conference this spring to gather information from the public and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft is asking lawmakers to give any new laws enough flexibility to allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; services such as HailStorm, under the premise that users will be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decide for themselves how much information they disclose to Microsoft and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictate how much the company will disclose on the Internet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mundie said the company is up to the challenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We're talking,&quot; he said, &quot;about changing society's infrastructure.&quot;
