Please find below the final call for papers for this year's meeting of the
<br>
Society for the Social Study of Science.  The meeting will take place in
<br>
Cambridge, Massachusetts, from November 1-4.  The deadline for submission of
<br>
abstracts is March 31, 2001.
<br>
<p><p>Fashioning the Future:  Science, Technology, and Visions of Progress
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 1-4,  2001
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Royal Sonesta Hotel, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA
<br>
<p>Scientists and engineers have played a central role in refashioning the
<br>
material and social worlds of modernity.  They have provided key resources
<br>
with which human beings and institutions imagine, and in part realize,
<br>
particular visions of progress.  These resources can also destabilize
<br>
identities, threaten security, and arouse resistance.  For example, in
<br>
biomedicine, genetic breakthroughs may allow us to remake the human body,
<br>
profile individuals and populations, and commodify nature in unprecedented
<br>
ways; in the information sciences, new technologies promise to provide ready
<br>
access to vast realms of information, facilitate new forms of human
<br>
interaction and consumption, and enable new forms of state and corporate
<br>
surveillance; in the military sphere, smart technologies may offer
<br>
unprecedented accuracy and striking power to the armed forces of
<br>
post-industrial states.  These new knowledges and technological forms are
<br>
materializing at the same time that processes of globalization are
<br>
mobilizing novel flows of capital, commodities, ideas, technologies, and
<br>
human migration across borders  and so giving rise to new forms of social
<br>
and technoscientific experimentation.
<br>
<p>The risks, possibilities, and intellectual puzzles of such a moment invite
<br>
conversation across disciplinary and intellectual boundaries.  Science and
<br>
technology studies has been an interdisciplinary field since its inception a
<br>
quarter century ago.  In this anniversary year, we welcome contributions
<br>
from scholars in such fields as sociology, anthropology, history,
<br>
philosophy, political science, women's studies, ethnic studies,
<br>
communication studies, cultural studies, and law, as well as from
<br>
practitioners of science, engineering or public policy.  While panels
<br>
showcasing particular issues or perspectives are always welcome, we also
<br>
encourage panels that cross conventional boundaries, whether by combining
<br>
perspectives from scholars of different nationalities, by juxtaposing
<br>
participants from different disciplines, or by staging dialogues between
<br>
practitioners and social analysts of science.  We invite proposals for
<br>
entire panels and for individual papers.
<br>
<p>Broad theme areas include:
<br>
               Technology Studies
<br>
               Science, Technology &amp; Environment
<br>
               Information Technologies
<br>
             Ethics and Law
<br>
               Medicine and Genetics
<br>
               Science, Technology and War
<br>
             Science Policy and Politics
<br>
               Innovation Studies
<br>
             Theory and Philosophy of Science
<br>
             Race, Gender, and Class
<br>
             Public Understanding of Science
<br>
<p><p>Deadline for Submissions: March 31, 2001.
<br>
Each panel will be allotted 1.5 hours and should contain no more than 3 or 4
<br>
papers.  Abstracts for panel sessions should be no more than 250 words and
<br>
should contain a list of panelists with their institutional affiliations and
<br>
proposed paper titles.  Abstracts for individual papers should likewise be
<br>
no more than 250 words.  Submissions received after March 1 will be
<br>
considered on a space-available basis.
