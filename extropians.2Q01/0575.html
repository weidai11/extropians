<p>Ah, yes, but it doesn't have negligible moral weight.  Suppose that
<br>
there's one original Eliezer and a billion imitators.  The chance that I'm
<br>
the original is only one-billionth; however, the actions of that original
<br>
would carry a billion times as much weight.  The original still
<br>
necessarily exists, and we wouldn't want that original to be misled by the
<br>
original Nick Bostrom, right?  Ergo, the whole possibility may cancel
<br>
right out of the moral equation...
<br>
<p>Even if it doesn't cancel out, this apparent world of the true Eliezer,
<br>
where the whole Singularity is at stake, weighs far more in my
<br>
calculations than whatever reasons a hypothetical exoself could have for
<br>
wanting to relive my life - even if the probability of being the original
<br>
is a billion to one.
<br>
<p>Right now, I am Eliezer, whether or not I started out that way.  I have
<br>
Eliezer's memories and personality.  And Eliezer doesn't give a damn about
<br>
the pathetic entertainments of citizens who are hanging back and reliving
<br>
other people's lives instead of joining the greater transhuman community. 
<br>
If this is a simulation, then bringing other citizens to that realization
<br>
was probably the reason the post-Singularity Eliezer licensed out vis
<br>
human life in the first place, if ve did.
<br>
<p>So as far as I'm concerned, the possibility that this is all a simulation
<br>
doesn't move me.  Who gives a damn if my exoself winds up being unhappy? 
<br>
I didn't force ver to license these memories.  As far as I'm concerned,
<br>
the actions of the original Eliezer and my current actions at this moment
<br>
are isomorphic.  I, in my capacity as the original Eliezer or a mental
<br>
isomorph of him, attach negligible moral weight to the happiness or
<br>
unhappiness of any future folk who want to rerun my life in simulation; if
<br>
they wanted to be happy, they should have modified the simulation
<br>
accordingly.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, if this is a simulation, it seems pretty likely that I'm
<br>
living out the exact and original life of Eliezer, as best it could be
<br>
reconstructed from his emails or even memories - which means that *this*
<br>
email, this *exact* line of reasoning, would have appeared back in the
<br>
original pre-Singularity world!  Obviously, then, whatever thoughts I am
<br>
having right now appear in the original pre-Singularity moral equation,
<br>
where they vastly outweigh the consequences to any volunteer exoselves who
<br>
only survived in the first place because someone successfully brought off
<br>
the original Singularity.
<br>
<p>Besides which, I still think this world is probably the real one.
