SPLC Intelligence Report: Pagans Are Radicals, Racists and Support The
<br>
Unabomber Yesterday at 8:41:43 PM (EST)
<br>
<p>Title: THE NEW ROMANTICS

<br>
<p>A Swedish expert on right-wing extremism says that racist Odinism is the
<br>
radical religion of the future.
<br>
<p>Mattias Gardell is a professor of religious history at the University of
<br>
Stockholm's Center for Research in International Migration and Ethnic
<br>
Relations. Although he is Swedish, Gardell has studied the American radical
<br>
right extensively since the mid-1990s, publishing two books and scores of
<br>
scholarly articles on the subject. After completing an extensive study of
<br>
the Nation of Islam in 1996, Gardell embarked on an another major research
<br>
project, interviewing several hundred white American racist activists and
<br>
spending long periods of time with key leaders. Later this year, the results
<br>
of this work, which focused heavily on the rise of neo-Paganism on the
<br>
radical right, are expected to be published by Duke University Press as Gods
<br>
of the Blood: Race, Ethnicity and the Pagan Revival. The Intelligence Report
<br>
interviewed Gardell about the rise of neo-Paganism and its meaning for the
<br>
radical right.
<br>
<p><p><p>INTELLIGENCE REPORT Why did you focus your most recent work on neo-Paganism
<br>
and the radical right?
<br>
<p>gardell When I came to the United States in 1996, I expected to write about
<br>
[Christian] Identity preachers, Klan leaders, militia leaders and all of
<br>
that. I didn't expect to meet all these pagans and to see a new generation
<br>
of racial activists so involved in pagan activities. I realized that this
<br>
was really big, that paganism was coming up strong and Christian Identity [a
<br>
racist, Bible-based religion that claims whites are the real chosen people
<br>
of God and Jews are descended from of Satan] was turning into an old man's
<br>
religion. It looks like a home for retired people. I found the youth today
<br>
go for Odin and Thor and Freya and all the other old Norse gods.
<br>
<p>ir What is driving the revival of pagan religions?
<br>
<p>gardell The popularity of Odinism today is connected to the revival of
<br>
paganism in general. In the first wave of this revival, the whole scene was
<br>
mainly leftist. Between 1968 and 1972, it was part of the hippie
<br>
counterculture, flower power, back to the land and away from modernism,
<br>
capitalism, commercialism, all that kind of leftist thing. It was also
<br>
connected to a rise in interest in pre-Christian African traditions and
<br>
Native American traditions. There was a revival of this sort all over the
<br>
Western world at that time. At that time in the U.S., the far right was
<br>
basically reactionary, Christian, into 100 percent Americanism and all that.
<br>
So paganism didn't play much of a role on the extreme right during this
<br>
period.
<br>
<p>But when paganism resurfaced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was now
<br>
connected to the right. The pendulum had shifted to the right in society in
<br>
general, a turn to the right epitomized by Reagan's election and a whole new
<br>
program of neo-liberal policies and deregulation and privatization, all of
<br>
that. A new generation was coming into adolescence at that time, and they
<br>
were part of that rightist wave. At the same time, this generation was made
<br>
up of people who had been brought up on [the fantasy novels of J.R.R.]
<br>
Tolkien, who played [the popular fantasy game] &quot;Dungeons and Dragons,&quot; and
<br>
watched sci-fi epics. They also listened to all this new music - industrial
<br>
music, Gothic music, black and death and thrash metal.
<br>
<p>When this generation met the Odinists, they found all of that, but in a
<br>
racialized and militant form. Odinism offered them a new grand narrative.
<br>
They could belong to something more important than themselves. They looked
<br>
with distaste at American society with its consumerism and materialism and
<br>
its stupid TV programs. Medieval knights and Vikings and all that looked
<br>
attractive.
<br>
<p>ir Racist Odinists tend to be more independent than members of traditional
<br>
hate groups. Do you think the rise of Odinism is changing the shape of the
<br>
movement?
<br>
<p>gardell Definitely. Most of the traditional groups could hold their national
<br>
meetings in a telephone booth, and very few of them last more than a few
<br>
years - although it's also true that for each organizations that dies,
<br>
another is born. Today, the number of white racist activists, Aryan
<br>
revolutionaries, is far greater than you would know by simply looking at
<br>
traditional organizations. Revolutionaries today do not become members of an
<br>
organization. They won't participate in a demonstration or a rally or give
<br>
out their identity to a group that keeps their name on file, because they
<br>
know that all these organizations are heavily monitored. Since the late
<br>
1990s, there has been a general shift away from these groups on the far
<br>
right.
<br>
<p>This has also helped Odinism thrive. Odinists took the leaderless resistance
<br>
concept of [leading white supremacist ideologue] Louis Beam and worked on it
<br>
, fleshed it out. They found a strategic position between the upper level of
<br>
known leaders and propagandists, and an underground of activists who do not
<br>
affiliate as members, but engage instead in decentralized networking and
<br>
small cells. They do not shave their heads like traditional Skinheads or
<br>
openly display swastikas.
<br>
<p>This comes close to what the FBI said in [last year's] Meggido Report [on
<br>
radical right groups]. They contended that the overwhelming majority of
<br>
domestic terrorists today do not belong to any traditional organization. So
<br>
you need to shift your analytical focus from organizations to a
<br>
counterculture. It is a counterculture that defines itself in opposition to
<br>
what is perceived as the errant direction of where American society is going
<br>
- multiculturalism, big government, all of that.
<br>
<p>IR The radical right seems in many ways to have further radicalized over
<br>
recent years, to have become Nazified. Has Odinism played a role in this?
<br>
<p>gardell Odinism has been part of this process of radicalization from the
<br>
outset. It goes back, most importantly, to The Order [a terrorist group of
<br>
the 1980s], which was founded by Robert Matthews, who was an early Odinist.
<br>
The revolutionary Aryan scene today is largely modeled on The Order. Pagans
<br>
have had another role in the radicalization of the movement: pointing out
<br>
that Christianity, in their view, is the single most important cause of the
<br>
demise of Aryan man. By breaking with Christianity - which they see as
<br>
unnatural, a religion that hails defeat and weakness and is symbolized by a
<br>
crucified loser - racist pagans burned more bridges to American society than
<br>
almost any on the radical right who came before.
<br>
<p>And Odinism has also made another contribution to radicalization. In the
<br>
past, militias and the &quot;Patriots&quot; in general claimed that the [original]
<br>
American Revolution had been betrayed, that you had to have a second
<br>
American revolution to return the country to what it once was. But David
<br>
Lane [an imprisoned Order member who runs an Odinist propaganda ministry
<br>
from his cell] broke with these ideas radically. Lane says that from the
<br>
very beginning, America was part of the Zionist conspiracy. To him, that is
<br>
why the American military has been engaged in all these wars ever since the
<br>
country's foundation. All these wars, in Lane's view, were fought to force
<br>
the nations of the world to submit to the Zionist dictatorship.
<br>
<p>ir So the American democratic experiment was tainted from the start?
<br>
<p>gardell It goes all the way back. Lane says you cannot be both white and
<br>
American. How could you possibly be what destroys you?
<br>
<p>Racists today, in contrast to the '50s and '60s, are not waving the American
<br>
flag. They are burning it. And this has helped globalize their message,
<br>
which has met and combined with the anti-American sentiment traditionally
<br>
found among European fascists and national socialists who never forgave
<br>
America for fighting on the wrong side during World War II. That has been an
<br>
important bridge.
<br>
<p>ir Let's change subjects. Could you give a brief explanation of Odinism and
<br>
Asatrú and describe some of how they differ from Christianity?
<br>
<p>gardell Odinism is a [20th century] racist reconstruction of pre-Christian,
<br>
Norse pagan traditions that were generally called Asatrú. These were the
<br>
religious traditions of Europe including Scandinavia, Iceland and Greenland
<br>
about 1,000 years ago before Christianity reached northern Europe.
<br>
<p>Norse traditions do not speak of one god but rather several gods and
<br>
goddesses. Odinism does not see the gods as being of a different nature than
<br>
man, but as basically being of the same nature. God, or the divine,
<br>
permeates nature and animates all living creatures, including trees and
<br>
animals, rivers and mountains. The whole earth is seen as divine. There is
<br>
no special distinction given to man. Odinism is not an anthropocentric
<br>
religion at all. It sees man as being part of nature and it sees the gods
<br>
and goddesses as being part of nature. Basically, it's a combination of a
<br>
pantheistic notion that holds nature sacred with a polytheistic view of a
<br>
plurality of gods and goddesses. This allows for direct communications
<br>
between gods and man.
<br>
<p>Most people I talked to regard the myths as containing some sacred form of
<br>
truth, but no one takes them literally. I have yet to meet one Odinist or
<br>
Asatrúer who believes Thor is actually a red-bearded, muscular,
<br>
anthropomorphic entity who wields his hammer to crush real giants. Each god
<br>
has limits. So Odinism differs from Christianity because there is no
<br>
omnipotent and omnipresent god. The gods have strengths and weaknesses, they
<br>
have desires, then enjoy sexuality, they have an appetite for life and they
<br>
may even die. The conditions of the gods are familiar to men. This central
<br>
point of kinship between man and the divine is key. So when gods and man
<br>
engage, they have an interdependent relationship more modeled on the family
<br>
than on one of master and servant. An Asatrúer would never surrender his
<br>
will to God. An Asatrúer or an Odinist, racist or not, would never pray to a
<br>
<p>god.
<br>
<p>The energies or condensed forces of Odin, Thor, Freya, and the rest are
<br>
symbolic representations of human potentials. They are aspects of man's
<br>
personality that need to be addressed and balanced. So the main objective
<br>
for most Asatrúers is to work on these divine inner energies in the quest
<br>
for self-metamorphosis, the act of becoming a god. This is different from
<br>
the Christian mystic who seeks to transcend humanity and become one with God
<br>
. In a racialized context, Odinism or Asatrú translates into the notion that
<br>
the European people are a divine race.
<br>
<p>ir Please describe differences between racist and nonracist neo-Pagans.
<br>
<p>gardell There are really three positions: the militant racists, the
<br>
nonracists and, in between, a third, &quot;ethnic&quot; position.
<br>
<p>The militant racist position claims Asatrú is an expression of the Aryan
<br>
racial soul, the original Aryan religion going back all the way to the
<br>
golden age. This thinking connects with the national socialist occultism of
<br>
German Nazis like Heinrich Himmler and a number of philosophers. They are
<br>
very much Jungian in their way of perceiving the racial soul, a racial
<br>
collective unconscious. For them, Asatrú, or Odinism, is for every pure
<br>
Aryan. And Aryan today is a wider concept than it was in the 30s, including
<br>
all those people who we now normally call white - Russian, Greeks, Iberians,
<br>
maybe even Iranians.
<br>
<p>The nonracists see Asatrú as available to anyone. There is no particular
<br>
connection to any tribe or racial group.
<br>
<p>Then you have the ethnic position that says Asatrú is an ethnic religion, a
<br>
tribal religion of the north. These people see the gods as present in the
<br>
form of archetypes engraved in the ethnicity of all northern Europeans. They
<br>
say this is not racism but tribalism. They are open, for instance, to
<br>
cooperation with [American] Indian nationalists. They are against national
<br>
socialists and fascism. But they are also against the antiracist position.
<br>
Unlike the racists, they do not see Odinism as a stepping stone to
<br>
implementing a global Aryan revolution. They never talk about ZOG [the so-
<br>
called Zionist Occupation Government], Jews or blacks but they are very much
<br>
ethnocentric. They are interested in European traditions, artifacts, history
<br>
and culture. They might study Icelandic and Norse languages.
<br>
<p>ir How do you assess the relative size of these positions?
<br>
<p>gardell The racist position has grown tremendously fast in the last four or
<br>
five years. The militant racists today probably make up between 40 percent
<br>
and 50 percent of Odinists and Asatrúers. And I would say the anti-racist
<br>
position makes up another 30 percent. And the remainder goes to the ethnics.
<br>
We are talking about somewhere around 40,000 people in the militant racist
<br>
position. More than half of young people coming into the racist right are
<br>
now pagans. Young people are not being drawn in by Christian Identity.
<br>
Racist paganism is the most important radical religion today.
<br>
<p>ir You mentioned earlier that neo-Paganism is very interested in nature. Is
<br>
there a link between neo-Pagans and radical environmentalists?
<br>
<p>gardell Yes. Paganism is very nature-oriented, geared to preservation of
<br>
mother earth. Pagans have a critique of modern society as destructive to
<br>
this planet. To them, it's insanity to think of man as a creature above
<br>
other species. So pagans tend to be radical environmentalists. Everybody
<br>
supports the Unabomber.
<br>
<p>ir Does Odinism's view of man as no more important than any other living
<br>
thing make racist Odinists more willing to engage in violence against fellow
<br>
humans?
<br>
<p>gardell I'm not sure if paganism is more violent than Christianity, since
<br>
Christians, however sacred they consider human life, slaughtered a lot of
<br>
people. Maybe there is a theoretical basis for this, but I haven't really
<br>
considered it.
<br>
<p>There is a warrior aspect to Odinism that appeals to a younger generation
<br>
that would like to make something greater with their lives. In some Odinist
<br>
groups, there are a lot of male paramilitary warrior ideals, a lot of
<br>
learning to hunt with bows and arrows and spears and all that manly stuff.
<br>
But still, Odinism is not as militarized as some of the Christian Identity
<br>
groups with their armed compounds.
<br>
<p>It's also interesting that in Norse traditions the relationships between men
<br>
and women were more equal than after the introduction of Christianity. So
<br>
you have the whole strong woman concept that clashes with the traditional
<br>
view of women as mothers only. In the Norse tradition, women are far more
<br>
independent.
<br>
<p>ir You mentioned the support of pagans for the Unabomber. In general, are
<br>
pagans connecting ideas of what are traditionally considered the left and
<br>
the right?
<br>
<p>gardell We have all been working with a simple left-right scale for too long
<br>
. If you lump all these groups together, national socialists, fascists,
<br>
radical right extremists, you make invisible the very important differences
<br>
that exist between an Odinist revolutionary and a Pat Buchanan. They are
<br>
both far right.
<br>
<p>You need to complement the left and right axis with another in terms of
<br>
centralization and decentralization. Then you see that groups that belong to
<br>
the authoritarian left and the authoritarian right have a lot of things in
<br>
common, like the red-brown alliance in Russia. The Stalinists and Hitlerites
<br>
have many things in common like the authoritarian state, their anti-
<br>
democratic nature.
<br>
<p>Similarly, the decentralist left and decentralist right also have a lot of
<br>
things in common. You have all these green anarchists, radical
<br>
environmentalists, talking about issues that are of great concern also to
<br>
many of the Aryans and pagans who are involved in the decentralist right end
<br>
of the spectrum. These are all the people who were in Seattle [for protests
<br>
against the World Trade Organization and economic globalization], on the
<br>
decentralist end of things. For all of them, it's a lot of anti-statism and
<br>
decentralism, back to the land, being self-sufficient, small-scale, being
<br>
concerned with pollution and environmental destruction, preserving wildlife,
<br>
all these things. It's very anti-capitalist. And also you have the rise of
<br>
this Third Position [an anti-capitalist form of fascism], one of the more
<br>
important ideologies in the racist counterculture today. That's almost all
<br>
pagan in orientation. Most of those who are Nazified are going back to the
<br>
early fascists, like the [pro-worker] fascist syndicalists in Spain. And
<br>
this is exactly where the pagans are.
<br>
<p>ir Is there something about American culture, other than what we've already
<br>
discussed, that makes young people here particularly amenable to paganism?
<br>
<p>gardell Paganism has a resonance with traditional American anti-
<br>
establishment philosophies, opposition to federal authorities and support
<br>
for local self-determination. It connects to the whole Wild West mythos. And
<br>
all of this is integral to the pagan message itself. You don't have any
<br>
kings; you don't have any presidents. You have tribal chieftains that have
<br>
authority because they have a natural or organic authority. If they
<br>
misbehave, if they prove themselves to be cowards, the people can choose
<br>
someone else. It's very decentralist.
<br>
<p>Paganism also connects to American identity politics, the importance to
<br>
Americans of ethnic ancestry and people's lineages. It's like the T-shirts
<br>
worn by African-Americans: &quot;It's a black thing. You wouldn't understand.&quot;
<br>
It's like the revival of Native American religions, of shamanism. Through
<br>
paganism, whites have an opportunity to do something similar, but distinctly
<br>
their own. In the face of an ever more multicultural definition of America,
<br>
they go back to northern Europe, where they find things to hold up in the
<br>
face of the multiculturalism and global culture. Roots and identity are more
<br>
important to Americans today than ever.
<br>
<p>ir Does the rise of contemporary neo-Paganism have historical parallels? And
<br>
what do these tell us about the dangers inherent in this movement?
<br>
<p>gardell Yes, there are parallels, but I don't think you should compare what
<br>
is happening today with the 1920s or 1930s in Germany and the rest of Europe
<br>
, as many do. You need to go back a decade or two earlier and look at what
<br>
happened at that time in continental Europe. There was a very similar kind
<br>
of revival going on then, a reaction against the spread of rationalism, the
<br>
notion that God was dead. You had the reintroduction of magic, a rise in
<br>
interest in alternative religions that looked east, like theosophy and
<br>
anthroposophy. There was a revival of paganism. And you had nudism and all
<br>
these alternative health therapies. All of a sudden, the pre-Christian
<br>
traditions of Europe came into vogue again. With all of this, you had the
<br>
rise of nationalist romanticism and racial mysticism and occultism and the
<br>
whole return of the medieval, chivalric sort of thing. All of the
<br>
philosophers who are so popular today among racist neo-Pagans were popular
<br>
then.
<br>
<p>At the time, there were all these small, small proto-fascist groups that
<br>
nobody really took seriously. They were too small, too dysfunctional and
<br>
fragmented, and they engaged in constant warfare among themselves. It was
<br>
really hard to see that it all could eventually be turned into something as
<br>
powerful as Italian fascism and German national socialism. But out of that
<br>
scene eventually arose movements that gained power and threw Europe into a
<br>
devastating war and created the Holocaust.
<br>
<p>So I think we should look at this very seriously. Even though some of this
<br>
stuff looks very bizarre - why pay attention to people who believe in old
<br>
gods like Thor and Odin or UFO cults or Hitler being alive inside the hollow
<br>
earth or this whole New Age concept? - it still has a lot of potential. A
<br>
return to fascism would not come in the same way today. But I think we need
<br>
to watch this scene carefully, even if it is not a direct threat to American
<br>
or European democracy today.
