<p>War driving by the Bay

<br>
<p><p>In a parking garage across from Moscone Center, the site of this year's
<br>
RSA
<br>
Conference, Peter Shipley reaches up though the sunroof of his car and
<br>
slaps a dorsal-shaped Lucent antenna to the roof-- where it's held firm
<br>
by
<br>
a heavy magnet epoxied to the base.
<br>
<p>&quot;The important part of getting this to work is having the external
<br>
antenna.
<br>
It makes all the difference&quot; says Shipley, snaking a cable into the car
<br>
and
<br>
plugging it into the wireless network card slotted into his laptop. The
<br>
computer is already connected to a GPS receiver -- with its own
<br>
mag-mount
<br>
roof antenna -- and the whole apparatus is drawing juice through an
<br>
octopus
<br>
of cigarette-lighter adapters. He starts some custom software on the
<br>
laptop, starts the car and rolls out.
<br>
<p>Shipley, a computer security researcher and consultant, is demonstrating
<br>
what many at the security super-conference are quietly describing as the
<br>
next big thing in hacking. It doesn't take long to produce results. The
<br>
moment he pulls out of the parking garage, the laptop displays the name
<br>
of
<br>
a wireless network operating within one of the anonymous downtown office
<br>
buildings: &quot;SOMA AirNet.&quot; Shipley's custom software passively logs the
<br>
latitude and longitude, the signal strength, the network name and other
<br>
vital stats. Seconds later another network appears, then another:
<br>
&quot;addwater,&quot; &quot;wilson,&quot; &quot;tangentfund.&quot;
<br>
<p>After fifteen minutes, Shipley's black Saturn has crawled through twelve
<br>
blocks of rush hour traffic, and his jerry-rigged wireless hacking setup
<br>
has discovered seventeen networks beaconing their location to the world.
<br>
After an hour, the number is close to eighty.
<br>
<p>&quot;These companies probably spend thousands of dollars on firewalls,&quot; says
<br>
Shipley. &quot;And they're wide open.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Absolutely Huge&quot;
<br>
Dramatic drops in hardware prices over the last year have made it
<br>
enormously attractive and convenient for corporations and home user to
<br>
go
<br>
wireless, in particular with equipment built on the 802.11 standard -
<br>
which
<br>
was popularized with Apple's AirPort, and is now widely used on PCs. But
<br>
computer security experts say that in the rush towards liberation from
<br>
the
<br>
tethers of computer cable, individuals and companies are opening the
<br>
doors
<br>
to a whole new type of computer intrusion.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's absolutely huge,&quot; says Chris Wysopal, also known as &quot;&quot;Weld Pond,&quot;
<br>
director of research and development at Boston-based @Stake. The company
<br>
added wireless auditing to their consulting menu approximately two
<br>
months
<br>
ago, after months of laboratory research convinced them that it was a
<br>
grave
<br>
problem. &quot;802.11 is inherently less secure than other wireless
<br>
technology,
<br>
Wysopal says, &quot;and the way it's being deployed makes it worse.&quot;
<br>
<p>The 802.11 cards and access points on the market implement a wireless
<br>
encryption standard, called the Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP), that in
<br>
theory makes it difficult to jump onto someone's wireless network
<br>
without
<br>
authorization, or to passively eavesdrop on communications. But in
<br>
January,
<br>
researchers at the University of California at Berkeley published a
<br>
paper
<br>
revealing a number of severe weaknesses in WEP that allow attackers to
<br>
crack the crypto with sophisticated software, and ordinary off-the-shelf
<br>
equipment.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hardware to listen to 802.11 transmissions is readily available to
<br>
attackers in the form of consumer 802.11 products,&quot; reads the paper.
<br>
&quot;The
<br>
products possess all the necessary monitoring capabilities, and all that
<br>
remains for attackers is to convince it to work for them.&quot;
<br>
<p>But the consensus at the RSA Conference is that attackers hardly need
<br>
resort to cryptanalysis. Most networks in the wild aren't using WEP at
<br>
all,
<br>
or are using it with the encryption key set to one of several well-known
<br>
default values.
<br>
<p>According to Wysopal, many corporate and home users erroneously believe
<br>
that their network name, or 'SSID', serves as a secret password. Other
<br>
implementers simply don't consider that their wireless network's
<br>
electronic
<br>
&quot;cloud&quot; extends beyond the walls of the building. If they've set up
<br>
their
<br>
wireless access points behind their firewall, they're opening their
<br>
internal network to anyone with a laptop. Even if they put their access
<br>
points outside a firewall, intruders may be able to use them to get out
<br>
to
<br>
the Internet, whether to stage attacks, or just for free bandwidth.
<br>
<p>&quot;I think almost every large hi-tech corporation has wireless exposure
<br>
now,&quot;
<br>
says Wysopal. &quot;Sometimes you can just drive into their parking lot...
<br>
turn
<br>
on your laptop and be on their network. We've seen it in a lot of brand
<br>
name companies that you would recognize.&quot;
<br>
<p>Al Potter, Manager of Network Security Labs at ICSA, has one word for
<br>
the
<br>
exposure he's seen: &quot;Terror.&quot;
<br>
<p>War Driving
<br>
Many here believe that hackers are already cruising around metropolitan
<br>
areas in cars and on bicycles, with their laptops listening for the
<br>
beacons
<br>
of wireless networks. Using such a network doesn't even require special
<br>
software or hardware, an ordinary $150.00 consumer wireless card will
<br>
latch
<br>
on to the beacons and put you on the net.
<br>
<p>Grand computer capers will be pulled off, not from bedrooms and college
<br>
dorms, but from windowless vans in company parking lot, and from park
<br>
benches and empty stairwells. &quot;It's fun, it's the new thing,&quot; says
<br>
Wysopal.
<br>
&quot;It's kind of like war dialing: you never know what you're going to
<br>
get.&quot;
<br>
<p>War dialing is the timeworn technique in which a hacker programs his or
<br>
her
<br>
system to call hundreds of phone numbers in search of poorly protected
<br>
computer dial-ups. The name comes from the movie WarGames, which
<br>
features
<br>
Matthew Broderick performing the technique.
<br>
<p>In the late nineties, as a research project, Peter Shipley war dialed
<br>
every
<br>
phone number in the San Francisco Bay Area-finding dial-ups leading to
<br>
banks, hotels, and scores of unprotected personal computers. The survey
<br>
took three years to complete. The goal, Shipley said, was to raise
<br>
awareness of the threat posed by unprotected modems, and the project won
<br>
attention from the print media and online news.
<br>
<p>Now, in the same spirit, and with the help of some hobbyist friends,
<br>
Shipley plans to &quot;war drive&quot; the streets of San Francisco, Oakland, and
<br>
portions of Silicon Valley to the south. When he's done, he'll have a
<br>
database that maps the geographic location of, in all likelihood,
<br>
thousands
<br>
of open 802.11 networks. He doesn't plan on publishing the raw data --
<br>
he
<br>
doesn't want to help attackers spot choice targets -- but he says the
<br>
numbers will speak for themselves. &quot;I can give you the density of open
<br>
networks an area, organized by zip code,&quot; says Shipley. &quot;People don't
<br>
believe there's a security problem if you don't prove it to them.&quot;
<br>
<p>Shipley says he doesn't plan on actually using anyone's network. But to
<br>
make the experiment real, and, perhaps, to avoid unwanted attention,
<br>
he's
<br>
already plotting ways to hide the hacked antenna magnetically held to
<br>
the
<br>
roof of his car. &quot;I'm thinking of putting a pizza sign on it.&quot;
