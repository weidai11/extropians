<br>
<p>An upcoming Microsoft system will use cameras and microphones to tell if a
<br>
user is facing the computer or talking, so it will know whether it can deliver
<br>
a message or a call.
<br>
<p>As if an antitrust battle wasn't enough, Microsoft has thrust itself into the
<br>
growing national debate over online privacy with its new Internet-services
<br>
initiative, code-named HailStorm.
<br>
<p>Microsoft is betting consumers will be willing to disclose more personal
<br>
information in coming years, in return for HailStorm's ability to simplify
<br>
online shopping, collaborating and communicating.
<br>
<p>Financial analysts say Microsoft may be the only company in the world with the
<br>
skill and clout to pull it off, but privacy and security experts say the
<br>
company may be overestimating how much information the public is willing to
<br>
share.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is sort of what defines you as an individual and I think there's some
<br>
real issues there about giving some company control of that data,&quot; said Mark
<br>
Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit
<br>
policy group in Washington, D.C.
<br>
<p>But Craig Mundie, the Microsoft senior vice president helping Chairman Bill
<br>
Gates develop future strategies, contended that people were also reluctant to
<br>
use credit cards at first because of privacy concerns, and now the cards are
<br>
ubiquitous because they make life easier.
<br>
<p>Mundie said the public will fully accept the HailStorm concept and Microsoft
<br>
as a trusted repository within five to 10 years. &quot;They'll trade off aspects of
<br>
personal information in order to get a benefit,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Gates presented HailStorm on March 19 as the cornerstone of a new generation
<br>
of Internet services Microsoft will offer starting next year.
<br>
<p>Initially, HailStorm will consist of a universal password and a service that
<br>
would deliver short text messages to computers, pagers, phones and other
<br>
devices. It would also automatically coordinate appointment calendars and
<br>
store personal files online.
<br>
<p>Eventually, the service will be able to watch and listen to computer users in
<br>
their homes and offices, so it knows when they are busy and when to interrupt
<br>
them with important messages and calls.
<br>
<p>Microsoft researcher Eric Horvitz, who demonstrated the seeing and listening
<br>
&quot;notification platform&quot; at a conference in Seattle last week, said it will
<br>
&quot;inform the notification manager as to how best to get information to you in
<br>
the right time and the right place.&quot;
<br>
<p>Basic HailStorm services, including an expanded version of Microsoft's
<br>
Passport authentication service, will be free when they become available next
<br>
year. Services such as automatic message delivery and calendar management
<br>
would be available for perhaps $20 to $50 per year.
<br>
<p>HailStorm would ultimately act as an online super secretary, arranging
<br>
appointments, filing documents, reminding the boss of a relative's birthday
<br>
and even helping buy and ship an appropriate gift.
<br>
<p>If you are in a car accident, HailStorm could automatically send your medical
<br>
history and insurance information to the hospital before the ambulance
<br>
arrived. Then it could page your spouse and reschedule your appointments.
<br>
<p>But for HailStorm to do its job to the fullest, users would have to entrust
<br>
Microsoft with all kinds of personal information.
<br>
<p>Already people share some personal information with their bank, other
<br>
information with their doctor and still other information with friends and
<br>
family. But most people don't give all that data to a central registry like
<br>
HailStorm, said privacy advocate Rotenberg.
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the ways we protect our privacy is by disclosing some of our
<br>
information in some contexts and not in others, and it's in that selective
<br>
disclosure of information that you establish bonds of trust and friendship
<br>
with friends and family members and others,&quot; he said. &quot;Sitting in the hub of
<br>
those relationships is the actual individual.
<br>
<p>&quot;What Microsoft seems to be doing here is saying, `Sure there's an individual,
<br>
but we can effectively map those data flows and extract them from the
<br>
individual and replicate them on a case-by-case basis,' and that's where I
<br>
think some substantial privacy issues arise.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another concern for some is Microsoft's ability to protect that data. In
<br>
announcing the service last month, Microsoft officials acknowledged the
<br>
company has been vulnerable to attacks and system failures, but it also runs
<br>
some of the world's busiest Web sites.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now, being honest, some of that experience is very good and some of it's not
<br>
so good,&quot; said Bob Muglia, the group vice president overseeing technical
<br>
development of the services. &quot;But we're committed to taking and learning from
<br>
the mistakes that we've made, such as the outage we had in January, to make
<br>
sure that we put in place the infrastructure so that we can run these things
<br>
with extremely high degrees of availability.&quot;
<br>
<p>Still, having a single company in control of so much information makes some
<br>
security experts leery of HailStorm.
<br>
<p>Centralizing data creates a target for attacks, especially if it's Microsoft
<br>
doing the centralizing, said Richard Stiennon, security-research director for
<br>
Gartner, a Stamford, Conn.-based consulting company that advises 60 percent of
<br>
the Fortune 500 companies.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're the most attacked infrastructure there is on the Internet, they're
<br>
the No. 1 target for hackers,&quot; he said. &quot;For Microsoft to take the step of
<br>
having a centralized repository of information, a login or whatever it is, is
<br>
something that Gartner clients won't be advised to do.&quot;
<br>
<p>Privacy and security concerns aside, Microsoft should have no problem creating
<br>
the sophisticated network upon which HailStorm will operate, said Giga
<br>
Information Group analyst Rob Enderle.
<br>
<p>&quot;Their image as a secure and trusted provider of this service is probably the
<br>
biggest Achilles heel,&quot; he said. &quot;The second is the fee.&quot;
<br>
<p>Enderle said Microsoft may overcome privacy concerns by partnering with a
<br>
trusted institution, such as Citibank, Visa or MasterCard, or perhaps even the
<br>
U.S. Postal Service.
<br>
<p>Sooner or later, Enderle expects services such as HailStorm will drive the
<br>
next wave of Internet commerce by providing a more personalized experience for
<br>
the consumer. And Microsoft could make it work.
<br>
<p>&quot;They're probably one of the only companies that can pull together the mass of
<br>
resources, whether that be software development tools or platforms, to create
<br>
an overall integrated solution among messaging, customer information and
<br>
e-commerce that would be required to really change the Internet market,&quot; he
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>Another hurdle may be Congress, where concern about online privacy has
<br>
prompted several proposed laws that could restrict the collection and use of
<br>
personal information. A spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said
<br>
privacy and Internet taxation are top priorities for his Commerce, Science and
<br>
Transportation Committee. McCain and Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., are planning a
<br>
privacy conference this spring to gather information from the public and
<br>
industry.
<br>
<p>Microsoft is asking lawmakers to give any new laws enough flexibility to allow
<br>
services such as HailStorm, under the premise that users will be able to
<br>
decide for themselves how much information they disclose to Microsoft and
<br>
dictate how much the company will disclose on the Internet.
<br>
<p>Mundie said the company is up to the challenge.
<br>
<p>&quot;We're talking,&quot; he said, &quot;about changing society's infrastructure.&quot;
