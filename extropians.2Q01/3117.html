</em><br>
<p>Not quite; liberals (US: libertarians) deny the very validity
<br>
of the socialist concept of equality of outcome. They want equality
<br>
of rights before law, but that's it. As for solidarity, they know
<br>
that being taken money by force to give it to other not only isn't
<br>
solidarity, but kills solidarity. Finally, while they approve
<br>
democratic representation as a way to limit existing powers, they
<br>
loathe the democratic myth of the unlimited power of parliaments
<br>
in the name of the will of the people.
<br>
<p>Social/democrats (US: liberals) have no consistent reasonable ideology
<br>
to speak of; what they have is a collection of myths that are emotionally
<br>
linked rather than rationally linked. Common myths include equality of
<br>
outcome, absolute democracy, the (self-defeating) principle of lack of
<br>
principles, confidence in the well-meaning of government, &quot;acquired rights&quot;,
<br>
social justice, the duty of government to intervene on the international
<br>
scene, etc. They have no meaningful notion of liberty.
<br>
<p>Liberals (US: libertarians) have a long tradition of critical rational
<br>
thought that can be traced back to Locke (or Aristotle, or Lao Tse, some
<br>
say), and the classic texts of the past can be read without shame, defying
<br>
the centuries to come with the validity and relevance of their vision.
<br>
Socialists (US: liberals) have a long tradition of pseudo-rational religious
<br>
superstition, rooted in deep ignorance of previous generations; their
<br>
classic texts are laughable in the way they contradict themselves, each
<br>
other, today's socialism du jour, and worse of all, life itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A. A high-tech egalitarian society is a sexier organizing vision than a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pastoral, Luddite society
</em><br>
High-tech egalitarian is an oxymoron. The very root of technical progress
<br>
necessary for a high-tech is in division and specialization of labour,
<br>
selection of the fittest, etc. Inequality is the very potential for progress.
<br>
[What was that quote that run like that, already:
<br>
&quot;if two people are equal, one of them is redundant&quot;?]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; B. Its far less depressing to see technology as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a terrain of struggle for democratic opportunities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than as a monolithically corporate juggernaut whcih
</em><br>

</em><br>
You've got things mixed up. Democratic struggle is basically a gang war
<br>
to see who'll get the protection racket. Government is violence.
<br>
Corporate juggernauts don't exist. Corporations can't force you to buy
<br>
their services; if they &quot;exaggerate&quot; in any way, competition will wipe
<br>
them off, unless prevented by government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; C. The fullest expression of automation and intelligence enhancement will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make possible the egalitarian visions of Marx and other utopian socialists,
</em><br>
Like women being equally shared between men (Plato)?
<br>
Like making virtuous humans devoid of the vices of old (Plato, Robespierre,
<br>
Pol Pot)? Like people living in egalitarian phalansteres (Fourier)?
<br>
Like making towns undistinguishable from country (Marx/Engels' Manifesto)?
<br>
Like people working for nothing under the fear of being publicly humiliated
<br>
(Blanc)? Like industry being militarized (Blanc, Marx, Lenin, Trotzky, etc.)?
<br>
<p>Are you just talking out of ignorance, or have you been seduced by any
<br>
particular utopy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; by eliminating necessary labor,
</em><br>
What's &quot;necessary labor&quot;? Necessary for what? to whom?
<br>
&quot;necessary&quot; as opposed to what? What's your dreamed opposite like?
<br>
Lenin himself said that people who won't work will not get food.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and with it the &quot;relations of production&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gave rise to classes and oppression.
</em><br>
You've been brainwashed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Genetic and body control will also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blur and eliminate race and gender distinctions.
</em><br>
Genetic and body control are tools. They will serve whatever purpose
<br>
people use them for. If you let people free, they will be used in
<br>
so many various individual ways as to enhance and multiply distinctions
<br>
between individuals, and in particular race and gender distinctions.
<br>
People will take advantage of their existing genetic basis when trying
<br>
to push forward towards new directions, so there will be divergence
<br>
and diversity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A. Defending transhumanist technologies, and the right to use them, can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be achieved by engaging in the political process, and not by diddling around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with anti-political abstractions like Privately Produced Law
</em><br>
The words Political and Right are antinomous. Diddling around is sure bad,
<br>
and there is a need to fight for our ideas on the public place, but your
<br>
saying that anti-political abstractions only serve this non-purpose
<br>
is but an insulting rhetorical form. &lt;insert here a more direct and
<br>
cruder insult regarding your having a sexual relationship with yourself&gt;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; B. The chief driver of Luddite passions is fear of the unaccounatble rich,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful and corporations using technology to disempower people.
</em><br>
First answer these questions: Just what is accountability?
<br>
When should anyone be accountable of anything to anyone else?
<br>
Then wonder to yourself what makes corporations unaccountable:
<br>
how is this accountability question specific to corporations?
<br>
Isn't it governmental legislation that created unaccountability,
<br>
where there previously was accountability?

<p><em>&gt; C. Anarcho-capitalism is bad social science.
</em><br>
Who said it was social science, to begin with?
<br>
Do you even know what anarcho-capitalism is?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm">http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All markets require social construction, and the rule of law.
</em><br>
FOO! If by &quot;construction&quot;, you mean human design, then NO, they don't.
<br>
Ever heard of emergent structures? of spontaneous order?
<br>
I particularly invite you to read nobel-prize winner F.A. Hayek's
<br>
&quot;Law, Legislation and Liberty&quot; with regards to the myths of
<br>
&quot;social construction&quot;.
<br>
<p>Also, anarcho-capitalists are FOR the rule of law;
<br>
it is statists who negate of rule of law.
<br>
Government, in its many foocratic and bararchic forms is
<br>
the very antithesis of the rule of law:
<br>
giving power to a few to defeat whatever law usually applies to everyone,
<br>
and to impose their own laws through a monopoly of violence.
<br>
They even corrupt the meaning of the word &quot;law&quot;.
<br>
<p>Anarchy means absence of leader, leadership, or any kind of power by people
<br>
over other people. It's neither anomy (absence of law),
<br>
nor chaos (absence of structure at all). Note that left-anarchists are
<br>
not real anarchists, since they want some committees to impose their
<br>
collectivist views on everyone.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Look at &quot;capitalist&quot; Russia in the 1990s for an example of the efficiency
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a market without a functioning state,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Germany and Sweden for examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the productivity and social well-being that can be achieved by social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic market economies.
</em><br>
Efficiency of what action as compared to what? Starting from what?
<br>
How can you compare a society that tries to reconstruct from the chaos
<br>
of a communist aftermath to societies that have lived fifty years of peace
<br>
and relative freedom, and from such a comparison deduce anything about a
<br>
particular trait?
<br>
<p>The same gross non-argument as you use could be equally used to say
<br>
that germans and swedes are a superior race to the russians,
<br>
or that a continental climate is really bad for the economy,
<br>
or that coca-cola is the cause of prosperity, fnord, or that the nearer
<br>
you are from France the richer you are, or that the mafia is bad,
<br>
or that the proportion of &quot;Erik&quot; in the population makes it wealthier, etc.
<br>
<p>The socialist meme is a dangerous virus whose means of propagation is
<br>
self-righteous ignorance. Like all french people, I've been fed this virus
<br>
all my life, so I know it well. The only cure I know is reading and thinking
<br>
(worked for me, but took quite some time -- Hayek's &quot;The road to serfdom&quot;
<br>
finally enlightened me). Since little of Hayek is currently on the web
<br>
(fsck copyrights!), you can still start from Bastiat.org...
<br>
<p>PS: I've had enough flamewars with ignorant morons in the past.
<br>
I hope you're not one of them. I will avoid any debate, least it's
<br>
based on rational arguments and documented assertions, as opposed
<br>
to fallacies and an ignorant's prejudices. Next time you attack or defend
<br>
some opinion, I expect you to have read a serious account of said opinion
<br>
by someone who shares it, or at least understands its point of view.
