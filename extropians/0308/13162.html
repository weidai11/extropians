of rat brain cells, suggesting that they could help extend human lifespan

<p>Activists pounce on nanotech scare. Being an activist means always having to
<br>
find something new to complain about...A recent 72-page report from
<br>
Greenpeace warns of the dangers of nanotechnology. An introduction from
<br>
Greenpeace's Doug Parr sets the tone for the piece, claiming that
<br>
nanotechnology-created &quot;materials should be considered hazardous until shown
<br>
otherwise.&quot; Huh? Abandoning technologies that can protect the environment is
<br>
hardly the most logical stance for a pro-environment group to take. The U.S.
<br>
Environmental Protection Agency, for instance, is already looking into and
<br>
funding the development of nanomaterials that can reduce harmful emissions,
<br>
aid recycling and filter gaseous pollutants...Greenpeace goes on to invoke
<br>
the tired rhetoric of class struggle, arguing: &quot;Is the future of
<br>
nanotechnology then a plaything of the already-rich? Will the much talked
<br>
about 'digital divide' be built upon, exacerbating the inequities present in
<br>
current society through a 'nano-divide?'&quot; In reality, all new
<br>
inventions--from air conditioning to clothes dryers to
<br>
automobiles--initially are the playthings of the wealthy. Then, as
<br>
production costs fall over time and economies of scale take over, those
<br>
products become available to more and more people. Still, Greenpeace seems
<br>
almost reasonable when compared to organizations such as the Canadian
<br>
environmentalists at the ETC Group, which published a communique that calls
<br>
for an &quot;immediate moratorium on commercial production of new nanomaterials.&quot;

<p>UNT, TI team on nanotechnology. Researchers at Texas Instruments and the
<br>
University of North Texas in Denton received $2.2 million this summer to
<br>
find a way to build computer chips half the size of those currently in use.
<br>
The new chips would be about 500 atoms across, said Phillip Matz, a TI
<br>
researcher working on the project. By comparison, a human hair is about
<br>
100,000 atoms across. The goal is smaller, more powerful chips. About half
<br>
the money is a National Science Foundation grant. The other half comes from
<br>
contributed services from TI and UNT. Most of the grant money will go to
<br>
support the graduate students who will work on the project. The grant is
<br>
part of a nationwide push to help scientists deliver on the promise of
<br>
nanotechnology, an emerging discipline geared toward making smaller and
<br>
smaller devices.

Comic-book authors a turning green with envy. For years, superheroes and

their futuristic special powers were exclusively the stuff of fantasy. But

<p>Europe announces more nano creations. As discussions regarding the potential
<br>
applications of nanotechnology become more frequent, research results from
<br>
around Europe are bringing some of these possibilities to life. German
<br>
researchers have announced their development of a  nanofilter capable of
<br>
removing toxins from blood, while a UK-Italian partnership has succeeded in
<br>
building the first nanomotor. The nanofilter, made from hollow fibre
<br>
membranes, removes specific toxins from blood quickly. The pores in the
<br>
walls of the hollow fibres, themselves only nanometres thick, allow only
<br>
contaminated blood plasma through. A consortium involving the company Gambro
<br>
Dialysatoren, the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft and the University of Stuttgart is
<br>
preparing to conduct the first clinical trials using the new filter. (CORDIS

<p>Roboblood...Back in June 1996, Chris Phoenix, a former student of nano-guru
<br>
Eric Drexler's at Stanford University, posted a question on the Foresight
<br>
Institute message boards: &quot;What about replacing blood with a complex robot?&quot;
<br>
This innocent inquiry led to a lengthy collaboration with Robert Freitas
<br>
Jr., author of Nanomedicine, the first book-length technical discussion of
<br>
the medical application of nanotechnology and nanorobotics. (Volume II is
<br>
coming out in hardcover next month.) The result was a 100-page paper in 2002
<br>
on what the duo termed a &quot;vasculoid&quot;-essentially a nanomachine that would
<br>
replace the human blood supply. Instead of having red and white blood cells
<br>
floating through your veins, some 500 trillion (it's not often I get to type
<br>
the word &quot;trillion&quot; when it's not in the same sentence as &quot;national debt&quot;)
<br>
nanobots would fill the entire vasculature of the body, some lining the
<br>
blood vessels and some swarming through them. (USA news 8/8/03)

<p>(Part 1) The mind of an American specialist in nanotechnology. The word
<br>
&quot;nanogram&quot; means one billionth of a gram. Nanotechnology penetrates within
<br>
nanograms, and rearranges atoms. If the atoms in coal are rearranged, it
<br>
becomes diamond (a mediaeval alchemist's dream). Such are its civilian uses.
<br>
As for its military uses, Mark Gubrud of the University of Maryland has
<br>
posted on a website his 18-page paper, &quot;Nanotechnology and International
<br>
Security,&quot; for the Fifth Foresight Conference on Molecular Nanotechnology.
<br>
At the beginning of his paper (p. 2) Dr. Gubrud says: &quot;Indeed, it is
<br>
plausible that a nation which gained a sufficient lead in molecular
<br>
nanotechnology would at some point be in a position to simply disarm any
<br>
potential competitors.&quot; (August 1,03) <a href="http://216.26.163.62/2003/lev8_01.html">http://216.26.163.62/2003/lev8_01.html</a>

is, to disarm the West. (World Tribune 8/15/03)

<p>Small matter, big impact. In this little town, in the basement of a house at
<br>
the end of a dirt road, sits a large laser that will make really tiny
<br>
bubbles, that might just be the next big thing. The house, laser and patent
<br>
on the process to make the bubbles all belong to Mark LeClair, founder of
<br>
NanoSpire. His company is one of a few in Maine playing in the world of
<br>
nanotechnology, a field that involves building or manipulating matter on the
<br>
scale of anything smaller than one micron - one-millionth of a meter, the
<br>
thickness of a typical bacteria. LeClair, a Scarborough native, has theories
<br>
on how to work with matter at the atomic level that have drawn interest from
<br>
some big names in the world of super-small technology. If LeClair's theories
<br>
hold - and he'll be testing them out using the laser over the next few
<br>
weeks - he'll have created a platform technology, a device with which new
<br>
technologies can be created and traditional industries can be advanced.

<p>Big questions for tiny particles. From clear sunscreen to self-cleaning
<br>
cars, nanotechnology seeps into daily life and starts to raise tough ethical
<br>
issues. In the days when the Beach Boys ruled the radio and bikinis were the
<br>
rave, beaches were populated by noses: big and slathered white with zinc
<br>
oxide to avoid sunburn. Today the big white noses are gone. Instead of
<br>
relying on thick goo, many manufacturers now use titanium-dioxide particles
<br>
so small the sunscreen looks invisible but still reflects away ultraviolet
<br>
light. Chalk it up to an early use of nanotechnology, where &quot;big&quot; is defined
<br>
as 1/1000th the width of a human hair and the possibilities look potentially
<br>
limitless. Yet even as nanotech goes commercial, environmental groups worry
<br>
about its effect on health and safety. Long term, analysts say, society will
<br>
have to confront a broad set of ethical and social issues as it deals with
<br>
humanity's growing ability to manipulate atoms, molecules, and biology's
<br>
genetic code. The real crunch may come if researchers manage to merge
<br>
nanotechnology and biotechnology. (csmonitor 8/15/03)

things) that nanotechnology threatens us with dissolution as a species...ETC
