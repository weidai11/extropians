Meet the 'transhumanists' behind the Pentagon terror casino
<br>
By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
<br>
Posted: 05/08/2003 at 11:01 GMT
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/32170.html</a>
<br>
<p>If there was an other-worldly feel to the news last week that the Pentagon 
<br>
was investing in an online futures exchange to reward terrorist atrocities, 
<br>
then the following few days have been even stranger.
<br>
<p>Rather more than any 'sexed-up dossier', which is a dispute about the 
<br>
integrity of intelligence material, this episode tells us far more than we 
<br>
would have dared to guess about the protagonists and their motivations, and 
<br>
what they think 'intelligence' really is. While we've seen economists and 
<br>
pundits rush to the defense of the aborted 'terror casino', very few 
<br>
commentators have examined the curious ideological motivations behind the 
<br>
ill-fated Policy Analysis Market, which at times appear determined to outdo 
<br>
any occultist. The phrase &quot;not of this world&quot; might spring to mind as you 
<br>
read on.
<br>
<p>Although the disgraced Iran Contra felon Admiral Poindexter duly carried the 
<br>
can - by Wednesday well-placed sources were leaking that he is to leave his 
<br>
post at the Pentagon's R&amp;D division, DARPA - the idea was actually initiated 
<br>
before Poindexter arrived.
<br>
<p>So let's meet the brainchild behind PAM, the blond haired and photogenic 
<br>
Robin Hanson, assistant economics professor at George Mason University. With 
<br>
phlegmatic good grace, Hanson announced the news on the Extropian Bulletin 
<br>
Board, that PAM had been axed. Hanson isn't himself an &quot;Extropian&quot;, he says, 
<br>
but many of his followers are, so maybe it's a good time you were 
<br>
introduced. And since they're being touted as the radical out-of-the-box 
<br>
thinking that US foreign policy needs, we must not delay.
<br>
<p>Yo! Hey! Meet the Extropians
<br>
<p>&quot;I am a 6 foot, 185 pound, 40 year-old, well-educated, married white male 
<br>
American, with two children. I have a wife Peggy, and sons Tommy and Andy,&quot; 
<br>
announces Hanson on his personal home page. All well and good so far, 
<br>
although you might be wondering why we needed to know his exact weight. Or 
<br>
that he's white. Both those details, and the fact that he's &quot;well-educated&quot; 
<br>
are pretty superfluous in Extropian circles, where the disciples are 
<br>
uniformly white and well educated. We're not sure if they all weigh 185 
<br>
pounds, but they're certainly very, very rich.
<br>
<p>How did it start?
<br>
<p>A few years ago a bunch of extremely wealthy Californians met, liked the 
<br>
look of each other a lot, and formed a group called Extropians. Revealed to 
<br>
the world in a Wired article in 1994 as &quot;a philosophy of boundless 
<br>
expansion, of upward - and outwardness, of fantastic superabundance,&quot; their 
<br>
greeting was described in some quite painful detail, for us, thus:
<br>
<p>&quot;Right hand out in front of you, fingers spread and pointing at the sky. 
<br>
Grasp the other person's right hand, intertwine fingers, and close. Then 
<br>
shoot both hands upward, straight up, all the way up, letting go at the top, 
<br>
whooping 'Yo!' or 'Hey!'&quot;
<br>
<p>Extropianism, we were told, expoused &quot;extremely advanced technology&quot; and 
<br>
displayed &quot;dedicated, immovable optimism&quot;. The hated gubberment got it 
<br>
particularly hard from these wealthy uberkinder, for whom the State was 
<br>
&quot;regarded as one of the major restrictive forces in the Milky Way galaxy.&quot;
<br>
<p>Employees of the government were mockingly described as &quot;entropians&quot;. They 
<br>
felt entitled to mock the poor or stupid, and amongst this self-selecting 
<br>
circle this amounted to almost everyone else, because they were confident 
<br>
they themselves would write the history books.
<br>
<p>But the most interesting thing about this ersatz cult was the amount of 
<br>
energy that its members devoted to wanting to live forever. To flee the 
<br>
surly bonds of mortality, once and for all, the Extropians devoted much of 
<br>
their disposable income (of which, there was much to dispose) to cryogenic 
<br>
research - deciding how to freeze themselves for eternal life, and deciding 
<br>
who amongst them Shall Be First.
<br>
<p>Time will tell if any of this elite will succeed and have themselves 
<br>
cryogenically reborn in a future time, but that's what they're hoping for. 
<br>
But give them a plaudit for their imagination. While the eugenicists of the 
<br>
thirties had a simple solution, which was to sterlize or isolate the poor or 
<br>
the ugly, or the lumpenproletariat who didn't share their happy thoughts, 
<br>
the Extropians have found a clean and politically-acceptable solution, one 
<br>
as we will see, that is endorsed by today's hygienic punditocracy.
<br>
<p>While Hanson disavows loyalty to any '-ism', he is true to his word in 
<br>
thinking outside of the box. Hanson was the ideal candidate to organize an 
<br>
online terror futures market, because the fellow has never met a futures 
<br>
exchange he didn't like. Or more accurately, he's never seen a problem that 
<br>
can't be fixed by setting up a futures exchange.
<br>
<p>Hanson modesly describes himself as Jungian type 'ENTP', and helpfully 
<br>
points us to the explanation that Jungian type ENTPs &quot;tend to be oblivious 
<br>
of the rest of humanity, except as an audience.&quot; Judge for yourselves.
<br>
<p>Take the humdrum business of democracy. He advocates replacing one-man, 
<br>
one-vote elections with &quot;values exchanges&quot; - another form of market. He also 
<br>
proposes an ingenious idea of bugging the undereducated, idle 'entropians' 
<br>
(and that must mean us) called &quot;Tax Leisure with Time Audits&quot; which 
<br>
essentially involves bugging the hell out of any 'entropian' who hasn't 
<br>
developed an Extropian's sophisticated spam filters:
<br>
<p>&quot;The government could randomly check on each person say ten times a year, 
<br>
and see if they are working for wages at that moment,&quot; he gushes.
<br>
<p>Intrusive? Hell, no.
<br>
<p>&quot;Of course to implement this each person would, when working for wages, need 
<br>
to be quickly contactable at random times, such as by staying at a desk, or 
<br>
having a cell phone or a beeper. But since most people will have such things 
<br>
for other reasons, the presumption could be that the exceptions are doing it 
<br>
to avoid taxes, and so failure to contact will be coded as not working for 
<br>
wages,&quot; explains Hanson.
<br>
<p>He's full of such good ideas.
<br>
<p>It's easy to mock the Professor as the kind of swot who grew up without 
<br>
having his head dunked in the toilet by the school jocks. But this time, 
<br>
it's serious. Not only is the Extropian ideology now blessed with Pentagon 
<br>
dollars, it's defended by our finest brains, in our most respected 
<br>
newspapers, and here we move on to the really interesting part of tthe 
<br>
post-PAM defense of the mystical market.
<br>
<p>&quot;Other-worldly&quot; is not an insult in these elevated circles. On the Extropian 
<br>
BBS a warm profile of Hanson at US News was reprinted with the proud 
<br>
headline &quot;Robin Hanson, economist for Starfleet&quot;.
<br>
<p>Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft
<br>
<p>Hanson's PAM provoked widespread public revulsion. But because it was billed 
<br>
as a &quot;market&quot; - the most mystical of things from which all wisdom must be 
<br>
divined - it was inevitable that interested parties who'd based their 
<br>
careers on upholding the divinity of the mechanism, rather than skeptics 
<br>
seeking to determine its flaws - should feel the most alarmed. Righteously 
<br>
alarmed, they didn't hang around.
<br>
<p>First up to the plate was Berkeley economist Hal Varian writing in the New 
<br>
York Times. Varian, with Carl Shapiro wrote a dotcom book on marketing 
<br>
strategies that eschewed the dotcom hype, Information Rules. Highly 
<br>
recommended, and justifiably so, Varian has been excellent company when 
<br>
we've called on him to discuss pricing wheezes.
<br>
<p>But the lush era of experiments is over, and somehow we found Varian 
<br>
throwing some extraordinary contortions in his Op-Ed piece last week.
<br>
<p>Varian insists that &quot;markets&quot; provide answers… answers we can't collectively 
<br>
work out for ourselves. Not only are they aggregators of knowledge, but they 
<br>
divine knowledge we couldn't arrive at through any other means, he says.
<br>
<p>Marching into the firestorm of whether the PAM could help us predict 
<br>
terrorist atrocities, Varian offered us this:
<br>
<p>&quot;Markets do an awfully good job of forecasting many events and trends.&quot; So 
<br>
far, so speculative, but do carry on. &quot;There is good reason to believe that 
<br>
a market set up to forecast the sort of political instability that leads to 
<br>
terrorism might work well, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>Anything wrong with this picture?
<br>
<p>Well, give him credit. Varian is quick on his feet: the forecast of events 
<br>
has been neutered into the far less specific forecast for &quot;the sort of 
<br>
political instability&quot; that might lead to an event, in other words, a 
<br>
terrorist atrocity. What sort, you might ask? OK, Varian now seems not to be 
<br>
claiming that the model predicts terrorist acts but the &quot;sorts&quot; [sic] of 
<br>
instability that might lead to a terrorist act. But to believe that, you 
<br>
have to believe there's a causal connection. Afghanistan, which after twenty 
<br>
years of civil war was probably at its most 'stable' when 9/11 struck, kinda 
<br>
disproves this. But let's see where Varian is heading. He's a man with a 
<br>
mission, only he's hedging his bets.
<br>
<p>About a third of the way through, he tells us:
<br>
<p>&quot;If you were a potential target, wouldn't you want the best possible 
<br>
forecasts of possible attempts on your life? I would.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah, so. After all that, it seems, he's now decided that the market can 
<br>
inform us of specific terrorist atrocities and by cutting off its funding, 
<br>
we are all putting ourselves in grave danger.
<br>
<p>Although Varian can't make up his mind whether PAM is good enough to predict 
<br>
possible factors &quot;that might lead&quot; to terrorism, or the devilish acts 
<br>
themselves, we must give him the benefit of the doubt and conclude that he 
<br>
is not suffering from multiple personality disorder, but merely producing 
<br>
rhetoric to serve his ideological cause. That might explain, if not forgive, 
<br>
his striking inconsistencies. He's committed to the idea that some 
<br>
collective intelligence, which we cannot explain rationally, resides in the 
<br>
market.
<br>
<p>The San Jose Mercury's Dan Gillmor, for once gave up his redoubtable 
<br>
moralism to plead, &quot;give them a chance&quot;. Dan, temporarily we hope, believes 
<br>
the approach deserves merit, although he doesn't say how, and he implies 
<br>
that there's power in the &quot;hive mind&quot;. He doesn't say where you can find 
<br>
this wisdom, and this is the beauty of link-and-run blogging: you rarely 
<br>
have to explain yourself to your readers.
<br>
<p>But a more coherent analysis is offered by Joseph Stiglitz, former chief 
<br>
economist to the World Bank, and Nobel Prize winner:
<br>
<p>&quot;If trading is anonymous, then it could be subject to manipulation, 
<br>
particularly if the market has few participants — providing a false sense of 
<br>
security or an equally dangerous false sense of alarm. If trading is not 
<br>
anonymous, then anyone with information about terrorism would be, 
<br>
understandably, reluctant to trade on it. In that case, the market would not 
<br>
serve its purpose.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then, amazingly, Hanson himself added that PAM couldn't affect futures 
<br>
because the sums were so small. An acidic Stiglitz wondered how the market 
<br>
could be so omniscient, if it had to rely on good old fashioned government 
<br>
defense pork in the first place.
<br>
<p>Market makers
<br>
<p>Harmless fun? Well, over the past twenty years
<br>
economists have faced several choices. If you follow the funding and tinker 
<br>
over the minutae of how markets work, and create elaborate mathematical 
<br>
models based on the metaphysical, then you can if you're lucky, land 
<br>
yourself a tenure.
<br>
<p>But all actions have their consequences, and to pursue such a path requires 
<br>
a certain hardening of the heart.
<br>
<p>This week I've heard from one Silicon Valley engineer who has been downsized 
<br>
to work at Target, for $7.50 an hour. Breaks are regimented, and in her 
<br>
elderly fifties, she wondered if she could keep on her feet all day. I don't 
<br>
blame her. Another staffer told me she was being called in to work at 
<br>
Hewlett Packard - a crown in the jewel of Silcon Valley - just so she could 
<br>
retrain her replacement in India.
<br>
<p>How is this so? If you want to be a Gillmor, you have to trust someone else 
<br>
to come up with the answer. However economists who want to ask why, and 
<br>
probe a little further, and ask why our economies keep failing, and our 
<br>
bubble keep bursting, typically don't get the opportunities that Hal Varians 
<br>
enjoy. There isn't an awful lot of money to sustain bad news bears. Some 
<br>
might even want to probe even deeper, and ask how we can maintain 
<br>
sustainable development, or even hope to motivate and train a prosperous 
<br>
middle class.
<br>
<p>The Extropian answer is simple: such dunderheads will be left behind as we 
<br>
all lift off into space, making giddy whooping noises as we ascend.
<br>
<p>Well, until last week we could dismiss these techno-utopians as a freakish 
<br>
cult, but now we know two things: they have they ear of the Pentagon, and 
<br>
they have powerful defenders in the shape of the New York Times op-ed page, 
<br>
and West Coast columnists. But there's an even more tantalizing narrative we 
<br>
can't entirely ignore.
<br>
<p>When the current US administration decided it was going to invade Iraq, it 
<br>
set itself in direct opposition to the kind of institutionalized 
<br>
intelligence gathering which the CIA regarded as its preserve. Whatever you 
<br>
might think of the CIA, it is undoubtedly an American cultural institution, 
<br>
in the sense that terrible shame will be wrought upon those sons of the East 
<br>
Coast patriarchy who fail the clan.
<br>
<p>Don't underestimate these Langley folks. The CIA may easily be satirized as 
<br>
an anonymous army of Agent Smiths, replicating at random, but this view 
<br>
underestimates the strong psychological sense that the CIA, and yes, it 
<br>
might be a paragovernment, capable of all the anti-democratic crimes that 
<br>
MI5 indulged in as it sought to undermine Wilson's democratically-elected 
<br>
Labor government in the mid-1970s, still feels ancient obligations to 
<br>
preserve The Republic. Like we say, you don't have to agree with it, you 
<br>
just have to grok that it feels its nose is very much out of joint right 
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>Now what are they faced with? We have the 'Office of Special Plans', a 
<br>
short-circuited, privatized intelligence authority reporting directly to the 
<br>
executive. And, here, fresh on the scene, is a whacko Pentagon-funded 
<br>
research project that claims to know the unknowable - backed up by top 
<br>
columnists! - all through the power of markets. Or some such voodoo, they 
<br>
that can't even agree on.
<br>
<p>Want to place a bet on how this one will work out? Contact our all-knowing, 
<br>
RSS-enabled Futures Exchange, please. We'll set one up as soon as we've 
<br>
parked your 'Hive Mind'.
<br>
<p>But the last word must go to a researcher friend who must remain anonymous, 
<br>
when I ran the op-ed pieces by him last week.
<br>
<p>&quot;Let's send them up on their own in a plane. Then they can form a futures 
<br>
exchange to discover how to land it.&quot; ®
