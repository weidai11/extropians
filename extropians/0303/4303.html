Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<em>&gt;I vividly recall the confusion among senior neuroscientists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;graduate students alike when we were trying to figure out the rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regulating our lunch coupons during a one-month neuroscience course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in Trieste.
</em><br>
<p>Trieste is almost not Italy ...
<br>
<p>I'll bet you couldn't figure out what was &quot;allowed&quot; for your first
<br>
course, for your second course, for your third course, what was 'free',
<br>
and what you needed to pay for.... (CNR has lunch tickets, too)
<br>
<p>There exists here a web of offerings that really do take care of an
<br>
individual that appears to be available to the individual at &quot;no
<br>
cost&quot;. Unlike that moniker 'you get what you pay for', some of it is
<br>
quite good (for example, the food).
<br>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes you cannot believe that things could
<br>
be run so badly or that they could treat someone so stupidly.
<br>
<p>(science, by the way, is considered by those in Italy as a somewhat
<br>
trivial and not very useful activity, that's my impression,
<br>
so far. Salaries of scientists rival that of bus drivers.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Much of this trouble is because we do not understand the important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subtexts. What laws can (and should) be ignored?
</em><br>
<p>My impression is &quot;Many&quot;.
<br>
<p>There are 200,000 laws in this country. Quite impossible to follow and
<br>
know what are all of those laws, yet there is an enormous bureaucracy
<br>
(who feel uncomfortable with technology) who tries to manage that.
<br>
<p>And you'll find that  the further south you go, the less meaningful
<br>
are the laws to people. (I keep hearing stories of the people in
<br>
Napoli especially, who make a kind of game of defying laws.)
<br>
<p>Unfortunately for me, because I'm a foreigner, if I don't treat
<br>
the laws  more seriously than the average Italian, then I'm out
<br>
of here on my butt.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;When is the proper response a gift?
</em><br>
<p>that's hard to know
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Italy strikes me as based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;informal social relations
</em><br>
<p>Totally. In the space sciences, where NASA email rules, Italian
<br>
astronomers are much more comfortable picking up the phone and
<br>
calling the others directly (or better, showing up at their door).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;managing a horrendously baroque formal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system that would not work if people actually obeyed the letter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rules.
</em><br>
<p>exactly
<br>
<p><em>&gt;While in Sweden and Germany the rules are relatively sane
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and are intended to be followed;
</em><br>
<p>(in Germany rules are more important than people, though)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;here informal relations are not welcome
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;It is well worth considering that Italy has a higher cultural power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distance (50 in Hofstede's study) than Germany (35) and Sweden (31)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(USA: 40) and a higher uncertainty avoidance (Sweden 29, USA 46,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Germany 65, Italy 75). At the same time individualism is higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Germany 67, Sweden 71, Italy 76, USA 91). So following rules and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;authorities is very important, but one acts as an individual.
</em><br>
<p>The most important 'unit' to the Italian is the family. Then the
<br>
local neighborhood, then the town, and that's where it stops. They
<br>
don't have strong feelings of 'unity' for the nation.
<br>
<p>In the time that I have been here, two important figures to many
<br>
Italians died: 1) the 'father' of Fiat, and 2) the actor : Alberto Sordi.
<br>
Politicians don't have as large of an influence. In both instances,
<br>
it was major national news, it was very remarkable to have something
<br>
that had such a 'unifying' effect.
<br>
<p>Sordi,  in particular, seems to have reached deep into the
<br>
consciousness of these people for more than half a century. For
<br>
them, he showed how stupid they could be at the same time of
<br>
reassuring them that their stupid ways were OK and more, it was
<br>
appreciated. One evening a few days after Sordi died, I had dinner
<br>
with a man who started to cry when I asked him what was his
<br>
opinion was of Sordi. (that's how much this actor was loved)

&nbsp;&nbsp;Rome Crowds Cry, Cheer for Italy Comic Hero Sordi Thu February 27,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2003 10:11 AM ET
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Estelle Shirbon
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROME (Reuters) - Grieving for a silver screen legend who portrayed
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their virtues and vices like no other, some 250,000 Italians gave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comic actor Alberto Sordi a rousing send-off on Thursday.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Massed on a square outside Rome's vast cathedral, the Basilica of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Giovanni Laterano, the crowd cheered and clapped out of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respect as Sordi's coffin arrived for his funeral.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's like losing a member of the family,&quot; said Angelina Olivieri,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;63, a tiny, soft-spoken woman in a prim red coat, choking back her
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tears as she spoke.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A familiar and loved face to generations of Italians, Sordi
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excelled at playing the ordinary man in slightly extraordinary
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances and squeezed every moment for its last drop of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comedy, tragi-comedy and absurdity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He died on Tuesday aged 82, unleashing a wave of emotion not seen
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Italy for years.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the great and the good piled into the Roman basilica to pay
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their last respects on Thursday, thousands of ordinary people from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all walks of life waited outside, following the funeral service on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially erected maxi-screens.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millions more followed the ceremony as it was broadcast live on
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state television.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When a loved one dies, a mass of memories and emotions crowd the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minds of those who stay behind. Since Alberto Sordi has died, this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has happened to an entire city, an entire country,&quot; said Cardinal
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camillo Ruini in his funeral oration.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd outside clapped and nodded as he spoke. One man in a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smart suit broke down in tears and knelt with his head bowed.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overhead, a small plane crossed over the basilica trailing a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;banner that read: &quot;This time you've made us cry.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahead of the funeral, Sordi's coffin was displayed in Rome city
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hall drawing some 200,000 mourners who filed past the open casket
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night and day to say their last goodbye.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, when Fiat patriarch Gianni Agnelli died last month,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some 100,000 people saw his coffin and 10,000 attended his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;funeral.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All Romans and all Italians loved Sordi because he brought us
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smiles and laughter, the greatest gift,&quot; said Valentina Dellana, a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;student with hair dyed flaming red, crying under her blue-tinted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sunglasses as she made the sign of the cross.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When policemen acting as pallbearers carried Sordi's coffin out
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the service, they were met with wild applause and chants of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Al-ber-to! Al-ber-to!&quot; echoed around the square.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the mourners wore the orange and red scarves of Rome's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number one soccer club, AS Roma.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was a real Roman and this came out in his acting. In turn
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans have adopted many of his mannerisms so that we often sound
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just like him,&quot; said Alfonso Maffei, a man in his 30s.
