<p>Optical microscopy sets new records. Scientists in the US have produced the

highest resolution optical image to date - showing details of structures
<br>
that are less than 30 nm across. Lukas Novotny from the University of

Rochester and colleagues from Portland State University and the University
<br>
of Harvard used a technique known as &quot;near-field Raman microscopy&quot; to look
<br>
at carbon nanotubes. (PhysicsWeb 3/7/03)

<p>Shaken Not Stirred. The progression toward smaller and smaller electrical
<br>
and mechanical components presents tremendous challenges to engineers and
<br>
scientists as they strive to create devices on scales measured in microns
<br>
and nanometers. One solution may be to develop materials that automatically
<br>
arrange themselves in useful patterns. Now a collaboration of researchers
<br>
(Igor Aronson, 630-252-9725) at Argonne National Laboratory and Institute of
<br>
Physics for Microstructures of the Russian Academy of Sciences has developed
<br>
a new method for encouraging microscopic particles to self assemble into
<br>
desired complex patterns.

<p>Australian overturns 15 years of nano-science doctrine. An Australian
<br>
mathematician has thrown 15 years of accepted scientific practice out the
<br>
window by discovering a design flaw in a key component of the Atomic Force
<br>
Microscope. His finding will force a rethink into the design and use of an
<br>
instrument that has become a cornerstone of scientific measurement and
<br>
analysis. Dr John Sader, at University of Melbourne's Department of
<br>
Mathematics and Statistics, and Particulate Fluids Processing Centre, used
<br>
established mechanical principles to prove that the popular V-shaped
<br>
cantilever inadvertently degrades the performance of the instrument, and
<br>
delivers none of its intended benefits. (EurekAlert 3/6/03)

<p>Physicists at the University of Missouri-Rolla have published the first-ever
<br>
three-dimensional images of atomic collision processes. The images, which
<br>
promise to further understanding of theoretical physics, accompany a paper
<br>
by the physicists in the March 6 issue of the British journal Nature. The
<br>
paper, &quot;Three-dimensional imaging of atomic four-body processes,&quot; by three
<br>
UMR physicists and colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear
<br>
Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, has enormous implications to theoretical
<br>
physics, the authors say, because it offers scientists a new look at how
<br>
ions react when they collide with atoms. Previous studies have shown only
<br>
two-dimensional images of the collisions, says Dr. Michael Schulz, professor
<br>
of physics at UMR, and one of the authors. (Newswise 3/6/03)

<p>Small is beautiful but only up to a point. Chris Benfield reports on new
<br>
horizons in a microscopic world. The prophets of &quot;nanotechnology&quot; - the
<br>
science of working in billionths of a metre, like Nature did when she
<br>
created living things - say it could build ladders to the stars, cure all
<br>
ills, make us richer than we ever dreamed, and record every move we ever
<br>
make. Now a group of scientific heavyweights have published an essay warning
<br>
that the whole booming business is heading for a row like the one about
<br>
genetic modification, as soon as people realize what it is up to. The
<br>
authors of the warning include Peter Singer, the former Oxford University
<br>
scientist who predicted, in 1976, that animals' rights would be one of the
<br>
issues of the coming decades. (Hoovers Online 3/5/03)

nanorelay consisted of a conducting carbon nanotube beam, a stepped silicon

substrate and three electrodes. &quot;These results describe a basic idea, a way
<br>
of building a nanoelectromechanical switch using small conducting
<br>
cantilevers such as metallic nanotubes,&quot; researcher Jari Kinaret told

idea out in order to stimulate experimental work on nanorelays.&quot;

<p>Smart Dust Senses Bioweapons. How can you protect yourself from biological

and chemical weapons? Forget duct tape. The answer is blowing in the

wind...To make the particles, which Sailor calls &quot;smart dust,&quot; he first
<br>
creates a filter for light in the surface of a silicon wafer about the size
<br>
of a quarter. He places the wafer in a conductive solution, and then
<br>
electrochemically corrodes it with an alternating current. Sailor says, &quot;as
<br>
[the corrosion] drills down into the silicon, it bottlenecks and opens up
<br>
again, then bottlenecks and opens up again.&quot; The result is a delicately
<br>
etched network of parallel pores about two nanometers in diameter. Using
<br>
ultrasound vibrations, Sailor then crumbles the wafer into particles about
<br>
the width of a hair.

<p>Breaking Glass under a Microscope. If you dropped a wineglass, you'd expect

it to shatter, not skitter across the floor like a silver goblet would. But
