<br>
<p>The Rage, the Pride and the Doubt
<br>
Thoughts on the eve of battle in Iraq.
<br>
<p>BY ORIANA FALLACI
<br>
Thursday, March 13, 2003 12:01 a.m. EST
<br>
<p>To avoid the dilemma of whether this war should take place or not, to
<br>
overcome the reservations and the reluctance and the doubts that still
<br>
lacerate me, I often say to myself: &quot;How good if the Iraqis would get free
<br>
of Saddam Hussein by themselves. How good if they would execute him and hang
<br>
up his body by the feet as in 1945 we Italians did with Mussolini.&quot; But it
<br>
does not help. Or it helps in one way only. The Italians, in fact, could get
<br>
free of Mussolini because in 1945 the Allies had conquered almost
<br>
four-fifths of Italy. In other words, because the Second World War had taken
<br>
place. A war without which we would have kept Mussolini (and Hitler)
<br>
forever. A war during which the allies had pitilessly bombed us and we had
<br>
died like mosquitoes. The Allies, too. At Salerno, at Anzio, at Cassino.
<br>
Along the road from Rome to Florence, then on the terrible Gothic Line. In
<br>
less than two years, 45,806 dead among the Americans and 17,500 among the
<br>
English, the Canadians, the Australians, the New Zealanders, the South
<br>
Africans, the Indians, the Brazilians. And also the French who had chosen De
<br>
Gaulle, also the Italians who had chosen the Fifth or the Eighth Army. (Can
<br>
anybody guess how many cemeteries of Allied soldiers there are in Italy?
<br>
More than sixty. And the largest, the most crowded, are the American ones.
<br>
At Nettuno, 10,950 graves. At Falciani, near Florence, 5,811. Each time I
<br>
pass in front of it and see that lake of crosses, I shiver with grief and
<br>
gratitude.) There was also a National Liberation Front, in Italy. A
<br>
Resistance that the Allies supplied with weapons and ammunition. As in spite
<br>
of my tender age (14), I was involved in the matter, I remember well the
<br>
American plane that, braving anti-aircraft fire, parachuted those supplies
<br>
to Tuscany. To be exact, onto Mount Giovi where one night they air-dropped
<br>
commandos with the task of activating a short-wave network named Radio Cora.
<br>
Ten smiling Americans who spoke very good Italian and who three months later
<br>
were captured by the SS, tortured, and executed with a Florentine partisan
<br>
girl: Anna Maria Enriquez-Agnoletti.
<br>
<p>Thus, the dilemma remains.
<br>
<p>It remains for the reasons I will try to state. And the first one is that,
<br>
contrary to the pacifists who never yell against Saddam Hussein or Osama bin
<br>
Laden and only yell against George W. Bush and Tony Blair, (but in their
<br>
Rome march they also yelled against me and raised posters wishing that I'd
<br>
blow up with the next shuttle, I'm told), I know war very well. I know what
<br>
it means to live in terror, to run under air strikes and cannonades, to see
<br>
people killed and houses destroyed, to starve and dream of a piece of bread,
<br>
to miss even a glass of drinking water. And (which is worse) to be or to
<br>
feel responsible for someone else's death. I know it because I belong to the
<br>
Second World War generation and because, as a member of the Resistance, I
<br>
was myself a soldier. I also know it because for a good deal of my life I
<br>
have been a war correspondent. Beginning with Vietnam, I have experienced
<br>
horrors that those who see war only through TV or the movies where blood is
<br>
tomato ketchup don't even imagine. As a consequence, I hate it as the
<br>
pacifists in bad or good faith never will. I loathe it. Every book I have
<br>
written overflows with that loathing, and I cannot bear the sight of guns.
<br>
At the same time, however, I don't accept the principle, or should I say the
<br>
slogan, that &quot;All wars are unjust, illegitimate.&quot; The war against Hitler and
<br>
Mussolini and Hirohito was just, was legitimate. The Risorgimento wars that
<br>
my ancestors fought against the invaders of Italy were just, were
<br>
legitimate. And so was the war of independence that Americans fought against
<br>
<p>Britain. So are the wars (or revolutions) which happen to regain dignity,
<br>
freedom. I do not believe in vile acquittals, phony appeasements, easy
<br>
forgiveness. Even less, in the exploitation or the blackmail of the word
<br>
Peace. When peace stands for surrender, fear, loss of dignity and freedom,
<br>
it is no longer peace. It's suicide.
<br>
<p>The second reason is that this war should not happen now. If just as I wish,
<br>
legitimate as I hope, it should have happened one year ago. That is, when
<br>
the ruins of the Towers were still smoking and the whole civilized world
<br>
felt American. Had it happened then, the pacifists who never yell against
<br>
Saddam or bin Laden would not today fill the squares to anathematize the
<br>
United States. Hollywood stars would not play the role of Messiahs, and
<br>
ambiguous Turkey would not cynically deny passage to the Marines who have to
<br>
reach the Northern front. Despite the Europeans who added their voice to the
<br>
voice of the Palestinians howling &quot;Americans-got-it-good,&quot; one year ago
<br>
nobody questioned that another Pearl Harbor had been inflicted on the U.S.
<br>
and that the U.S. had all the right to respond. As a matter of fact, it
<br>
should have happened before. I mean when Bill Clinton was president, and
<br>
small Pearl Harbors were bursting abroad. In Somalia, in Kenya, in Yemen. As
<br>
I shall never tire of repeating, we did not need September 11 to see that
<br>
the cancer was there. September 11 was the excruciating confirmation of a
<br>
reality which had been burning for decades, the indisputable diagnosis of a
<br>
doctor who waves an X-ray and brutally snaps: &quot;My dear Sir, you have
<br>
cancer.&quot; Had Mr. Clinton spent less time with voluptuous girls, had he made
<br>
smarter use of the Oval Office, maybe September 11 would not have occurred.
<br>
And, needless to say, even less would it have occurred if the first George
<br>
Bush had removed Saddam with the Gulf War. For Christ's sake, in 1991 the
<br>
Iraqi army deflated like a pricked balloon. It disintegrated so quickly, so
<br>
easily, that even I captured four of its soldiers. I was behind a dune in
<br>
the Saudi desert, all alone. Four skeletal creatures in ragged uniforms came
<br>
toward me with arms raised, and whispered: &quot;Bush, Bush.&quot; Meaning: &quot;Please
<br>
take me prisoner. I am so thirsty, so hungry.&quot; So I took them prisoner. I
<br>
delivered them to the Marine in charge, and instead of congratulating me he
<br>
grumbled: &quot;Dammit! Some more?!?&quot; Yet the Americans did not get to Baghdad,
<br>
did not remove Saddam. And, to thank them, Saddam tried to kill their
<br>
president. The same president who had left him in power. In fact, at times I
<br>
wonder if this war isn't also a long-awaited retaliation, a filial revenge,
<br>
a promise made by the son to the father. Like in a Shakespearean tragedy.
<br>
Better, a Greek one.
<br>
<p>The third reason is the wrong way in which the promise has materialized.
<br>
Let's admit it: from September 11 until last summer, all the stress was put
<br>
on bin Laden, on al Qaeda, on Afghanistan. Saddam and Iraq were practically
<br>
ignored. Only when it became clear that bin Laden was in good health, that
<br>
the solemn commitment to take him dead or alive had failed, were we reminded
<br>
that Saddam existed too. That he was not a gentle soul, that he cut the
<br>
tongues and ears of his adversaries, that he killed children in front of
<br>
their parents, that he decapitated women then displayed their heads in the
<br>
streets, that he kept his prisoners in cells as small as coffins, that he
<br>
made his biological or chemical experiments on them too. That he had
<br>
connections with al Qaeda and supported terrorism, that he rewarded the
<br>
families of Palestinian kamikazes at the rate of $25,000 each. That he had
<br>
never disarmed, never given up his arsenal of deadly weapons, thus the U.N.
<br>
should send back the inspectors, and let's be serious: if seventy years ago
<br>
the ineffective League of Nations had sent its inspectors to Germany, do you
<br>
think that Hitler would have shown them Peenemünde where Von Braun was
<br>
manufacturing V2s? Do you think that Hitler would have disclosed the camps
<br>
of Auschwitz, of Mauthausen, Buchenwald, Dachau? Yet the inspection comedy
<br>
resumed. With such intensity that the role of prima donna passed from bin
<br>
Laden to Saddam, and the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the engineer of
<br>
September 11, was greeted almost with indifference. A comedy marked by the
<br>
double games of the inspectors and the conflicting strategies of Mr. Bush
<br>
who on the one hand asked the Security Council for permission to use force
<br>
and on the other sent his troops to the front. In less than two months, a
<br>
quarter of a million troops. With the British and Australians, 310,000. And
<br>
all this without realizing that his enemies (but I should say the enemies of
<br>
the West) are not only in Baghdad.
<br>
<p>They are also in Europe. They are in Paris where the mellifluous Jacques
<br>
Chirac does not give a damn for peace but plans to satisfy his vanity with
<br>
the Nobel Peace Prize. Where there is no wish to remove Saddam Hussein
<br>
because Saddam Hussein means the oil that the French companies pump from
<br>
Iraqi wells. And where (forgetting a little flaw named Petain) France chases
<br>
its Napoleonic desire to dominate the European Union, to establish its
<br>
hegemony over it. They are in Berlin, where the party of the mediocre
<br>
Gerhard Schröder won the elections by comparing Mr. Bush to Hitler, where
<br>
American flags are soiled with the swastika, and where, in the dream of
<br>
playing the masters again, Germans go arm-in-arm with the French. They are
<br>
in Rome where the communists left by the door and re-entered through the
<br>
window like the birds of the Hitchcock movie. And where, pestering the world
<br>
with his ecumenism, his pietism, his Thirdworldism, Pope Wojtyla receives
<br>
Tariq Aziz as a dove or a martyr who is about to be eaten by lions. (Then he
<br>
sends him to Assisi where the friars escort him to the tomb of St. Francis.)
<br>
In the other European countries, it is more or less the same. In Europe your
<br>
enemies are everywhere, Mr. Bush. What you quietly call &quot;differences of
<br>
opinion&quot; are in reality pure hate. Because in Europe pacifism is synonymous
<br>
with anti-Americanism, sir, and accompanied by the most sinister revival of
<br>
anti-Semitism the anti-Americanism triumphs as much as in the Islamic world.
<br>
Haven't your ambassadors informed you? Europe is no longer Europe. It is a
<br>
province of Islam, as Spain and Portugal were at the time of the Moors. It
<br>
hosts almost 16 million Muslim immigrants and teems with mullahs, imams,
<br>
mosques, burqas, chadors. It lodges thousands of Islamic terrorists whom
<br>
governments don't know how to identify and control. People are afraid, and
<br>
in waving the flag of pacifism--pacifism synonymous with
<br>
anti-Americanism--they feel protected.
<br>
<p>Besides, Europe does not care for the 221,484 Americans who died for her in
<br>
the Second World War. Rather than gratitude, their cemeteries give rise to
<br>
resentment. As a consequence, in Europe nobody will back this war. Not even
<br>
nations which are officially allied with the U.S., not even the prime
<br>
ministers who call you &quot;My friend George.&quot; (Like Silvio Berlusconi.) In
<br>
Europe you only have one friend, one ally, sir: Tony Blair. But Mr. Blair
<br>
too leads a country which is invaded by the Moors. A country that hides that
<br>
resentment. Even his party opposes him, and by the way: I owe you an
<br>
apology, Mr. Blair. In my book &quot;The Rage and the Pride,&quot; I was unfair to
<br>
you. Because I wrote that you would not persevere with your guts, that you
<br>
would drop them as soon as it would no longer serve your political
<br>
interests. With impeccable coherence, instead, you are sacrificing those
<br>
interests to your convictions. Indeed, I apologize. I also withdraw the
<br>
phrase I used to comment on your excess of courtesy toward Islamic culture:
<br>
&quot;If our culture has the same value as the one that imposes the burqa, why do
<br>
you spend your summers in my Tuscany and not in Saudi Arabia?&quot; Now I say:
<br>
&quot;My Tuscany is your Tuscany, sir. My home is your home.&quot;
<br>
<p>The final reason for my dilemma is the definition that Mr. Bush and Mr.
<br>
Blair and their advisors give of this war: &quot;A Liberation war. A humanitarian
<br>
war to bring freedom and democracy to Iraq.&quot; Oh, no. Humanitarianism has
<br>
nothing to do with wars. All wars, even just ones, are death and destruction
<br>
and atrocities and tears. And this is not a liberation war, a war like the
<br>
Second World War. (By the way: neither is it an &quot;oil war,&quot; as the pacifists
<br>
who never yell against Saddam or bin Laden maintain in their rallies.
<br>
Americans do not need Iraqi oil.) It is a political war. A war made in cold
<br>
blood to respond to the Holy War that the enemies of the West declared upon
<br>
the West on September 11. It is also a prophylactic war. A vaccine, a
<br>
surgery that hits Saddam because, (Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair believe), among
<br>
the various focuses of cancer Saddam is the most obvious and dangerous one.
<br>
Moreover, the obstacle that once removed will permit them to redesign the
<br>
map of the Middle East as the British and the French did after the fall of
<br>
the Ottoman Empire. To redesign it and to spread a Pax Romana, pardon, a Pax
<br>
Americana, in which everybody will prosper through freedom and democracy.
<br>
Again, no. Freedom cannot be a gift. And democracy cannot be imposed with
<br>
bombs, with occupation armies. As my father said when he asked the
<br>
anti-fascists to join the Resistance, and as today I say to those who
<br>
honestly rely on the Pax Americana, people must conquer freedom by
<br>
themselves. Democracy must come from their will, and in both cases a country
<br>
must know what they consist of. In Europe the Second World War was a
<br>
liberation war not because it brought novelties called freedom and democracy
<br>
but because it re-established them. Because Europeans knew what they
<br>
consisted of. The Japanese did not: it is true. In Japan, those two
<br>
treasures were somehow a gift, a refund for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But
<br>
Japan had already started its process of modernization, and did not belong
<br>
to the Islamic world. As I write in my book when I call bin Laden the tip of
<br>
the iceberg and I define the iceberg as a mountain that has not moved for
<br>
1,400 years, that for 1,400 years has not changed, that has not emerged from
<br>
its blindness, freedom and democracy are totally unrelated to the
<br>
ideological texture of Islam. To the tyranny of theocratic states. So their
<br>
people refuse them, and even more they want to erase ours.
<br>
<p>Upheld by their stubborn optimism, the same optimism for which at the Alamo
<br>
they fought so well and all died slaughtered by Santa Anna, Americans think
<br>
that in Baghdad they will be welcomed as they were in Rome and Florence and
<br>
Paris. &quot;They'll cheer us, throw us flowers.&quot; Maybe. In Baghdad anything can
<br>
happen. But after that? Nearly two-thirds of the Iraqis are Shiites who have
<br>
always dreamed of establishing an Islamic Republic of Iraq, and the Soviets
<br>
too were once cheered in Kabul. They too imposed their peace. They even
<br>
succeeded in convincing women to take off their burqa, remember? After a
<br>
while, though, they had to leave. And the Taliban came. Thus, I ask: what if
<br>
instead of learning freedom Iraq becomes a second Talibani Afghanistan? What
<br>
if instead of becoming democratized by the Pax Americana the whole Middle
<br>
East blows up and the cancer multiplies? As a proud defender of the West's
<br>
civilization, without reservations I should join Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair in
<br>
the new Alamo. Without reluctance I should fight and die with them. And this
<br>
is the only thing about which I have no doubts at all.
