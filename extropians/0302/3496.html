This is a post I am putting both on Cryonet and the Extropians list.

I do hope that Lemler or someone else at Alcor tells their side of this
<br>
story, too. Possibly even to the same newspapers, if those newspapers play
<br>
fairly. The statements in these interviews could prove damaging if no one
<br>
comes forward to explain or even contradict them.

<br>
<p>I feel very disturbed by the Buzz Hamon development, and I would hope Dr.
<br>
Lemler and Bill Haworth (the Alcor public relations heavy hitter) are able
<br>
to take the bull by the horns before things spin out of control.
<br>
<p>ESPN.com news services
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Williams' close friend, Buzz Hamon, said the last time he spoke with The
<br>
Splendid Splinter, Williams said, &quot;I need a lawyer ... Because I made a
<br>
mistake.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then the phone went dead.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is simply conjecture on Buzz Hamon's part on what really was going on
<br>
here.  If he had really been concerned about things, he would have
<br>
immediately called the police! lol  And if this incident, which supposedly
<br>
happened was so important, why did Buzz wait till now (long after the Ted
<br>
Williams controversy has died down) to finally announce it to the world?
<br>
This does not add up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Hamon provided the details to Bill Madden of the New York Daily News for a
<br>
story that was published Wednesday. The impetus behind Hamon's cross-country
<br>
journey two weeks ago from his home in Greenville, S.C., to the Alcor Life
<br>
Extension Foundation in Scottsdale was simple: He wanted to see for himself
<br>
Williams' final resting place.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The author of this article is stuck in very conventional modes of thought.
<br>
Alcor is much too expensive and time intensive to be a cold storage
<br>
mausoleum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Hamon was Williams' constant companion for 4  years and director of the Hall
<br>
of Fame hitter's museum in Hernando, Fla. Hamon arranged all of Williams'
<br>
travels -- to Cooperstown each summer, the All-Star Game and various other
<br>
baseball events -- and their relationship grew strong enough that Hamon was
<br>
thought of as an &quot;adopted son.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I can understand then why Hamon is so concerned about Ted's current status.
<br>
I just wish he had some vision &amp; grasp of where technology is headed.
<br>
Sometime in the late 21st century Ted is going to be standing over Buzz
<br>
Hamon's grave and wishing this man who was like a son to him had not been so
<br>
terribly close-minded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
According to the newspaper's account, that was the problem as far as
<br>
Williams' real son, John Henry, was concerned. So, John Henry gradually
<br>
eased Hamon out as director of the museum and assumed total control of his
<br>
father's life.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We seem to get our share of controversial people in the cryonics movement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
In the months that followed, Wiliams' daughter Bobby Jo Ferrell spent more
<br>
than $50,000 in a failed effort to convince a judge to have the body
<br>
released from the cryogenics lab so that it could be cremated per Williams'
<br>
wishes.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, no one with close ties to Williams was allowed access to the lab
<br>
as Williams' body hung suspended in a giant cylinder.
<br>
<p>Hamon couldn't accept that.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And yet he waited so long to finally speak his mind??
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
With the help of Bobbie Sgrillo, a friend and former mortician who lives in
<br>
Phoenix, Hamon gained access to Alcor. According to the Daily News,
<br>
Sgrillo's knowledge of the mortuary business enabled her to gain the
<br>
confidence of overly protective Alcor officials, who -- after interviewing
<br>
her for a half-hour -- agreed to give her a tour of the facility. She then
<br>
asked if she could bring along Hamon, whom she introduced to them as &quot;my
<br>
friend Art, a public-relations man.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Considering the vast number of tours given to people by Alcor, I would
<br>
hardly say they are  over-protective!   It s nice to know the foundation
<br>
here is built on lies and deception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;After what I saw and experienced, I just can't contain myself any longer,&quot;
<br>
Hamon told the Daily News by phone Tuesday. &quot;I want the whole world to know
<br>
what they've done to Ted. This was absolutely horrifying.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Buzz, I honestly think the world already knows!  Between numerous TV.
<br>
specials &amp; newspaper articles the public has a dang good idea.  Lol  I would
<br>
like to see a new TV. reality show where this man goes to a mortuary,
<br>
hospital, veterinarian's clinic, dentist's office, etc. describing the
<br>
horrifying conditions of early 21st century life and how they could impact
<br>
Ted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
Hamon told the newspaper he was &quot;appalled&quot; by the cluttered conditions
<br>
inside the facility, then gave the Daily News the following account of
<br>
entering the containment room where Williams' body is stored:
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I have recently been to the Alcor facility and know (I helped straighten
<br>
some things up) they are not very cluttered at all considering remodeling is
<br>
going on.  Maybe Buzz just got lost and wound up in Hugh Hixon's workroom!
<br>
Lol!  :  )
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&quot;There were six huge cylinders along the wall, one of which was filled with
<br>
liquid nitrogen to supply the other five. I was stunned when [Alcor CEO
<br>
Jerry Lemler] told me they had 55 'patients,' as he called them. How could
<br>
they have so many?
<br>
<p>&quot;Then he told me there were four full bodies and five heads in each of the
<br>
cylinders. In addition, there were two short cylinders with just heads in
<br>
them.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hamon said he &quot;was horrified&quot; to hear that Williams' body was not stored in
<br>
a separate cylinder.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Buzz Hamon is totally right!  We need special celebrity/V.I.P.  penthouse
<br>
dewars which hold only one body, even though they could easily hold four or
<br>
more.  If Ted lived in a nice mansion with lots of wasted space while he was
<br>
up and breathing, then while deanimated he needs a full dewar to himself!  I
<br>
demand at once a response from Alcor on this!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;All I could think of was Ted and what he would have thought if he'd known
<br>
what John Henry had done to him,&quot; Hamon told the Daily News. &quot;It was bad
<br>
enough knowing that somewhere in one of these cylinders, Ted was hanging
<br>
suspended, upside down, with his head in a bucket. But he was in there with
<br>
four or five other bodies and assorted heads.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And some of the people he shares the dewar with may not be folks he would
<br>
want to associate with!  Why, some of them may not have even been baseball
<br>
fans!  A dewar should definitely be set aside for strictly baseball Hall of
<br>
Famer's, and no one else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;For all the money this supposedly cost John Henry, he wouldn't even see to
<br>
it that Ted was alone.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Buzz, unless John Henry made a big donation on top of the suspension policy
<br>
price, he simply paid what everyone else does.  So please don't be thinking
<br>
you get luxurious beachfront property for 50 to a 120 grand when Alcor is
<br>
the Malibu of cryonics!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;I was a little taken aback at the sanitary conditions because of my
<br>
experience in the mortuary business,&quot; Sgrillo told the newspaper when
<br>
reached in Phoenix. &quot;But what really concerned me were the dangerously low
<br>
levels of nitrogen in each of the tanks. It was when I asked (Lemler) about
<br>
that he said: 'Tour's over!'
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I took part in a recent suspension at Alcor, and can attest to the fact they
<br>
keep the operating room area very clean.  After the patient was taken to a
<br>
cool down tank, we scrubbed the place down top to bottom.  The mortician
<br>
should have given explicit details regarding the lack of sanitary conditions
<br>
or simply not spoken at all.
<br>
<p>The  dangerously low levels of liquid nitrogen in the tanks  statement
<br>
sounds like the words of someone who just does not know what they are
<br>
talking about.  I can understand why Dr. Lemler may have gotten fed up and
<br>
finally said  tours over!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;When I asked them about this whole process, they said: 'We don't promise
<br>
anything. We don't know what's on the other end.' &quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>While you re at it Dr. lemler (and Professor Ettinger), we would all like
<br>
from now on a guarantee for all cryonicists stating not only will we make it
<br>
in great shape to the future, but not have ANY problems on the other side.
<br>
;  )
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
When reached by the Daily News on Tuesday, Lemler said he does not recall
<br>
the visit by Hamon and Sgrillo and denied that there are problems with
<br>
nitrogen levels in the Alcor facility. When asked by the newspaper about its
<br>
sanitary conditions, he said &quot;no comment.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A part of me wonders if Buzz and his friend even DID visit the Alcor
<br>
facility!  But perhaps they did and Dr. Lemler does not remember them
<br>
because of all the other people he gives tours to (despite all the intense
<br>
secrecy!).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;I just can't believe people believe in this,&quot; Sgrillo told the Daily News,
<br>
&quot;that their loved ones can be brought back to life. Are they really that
<br>
stupid?&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sgrillo is not worthy to tie the shoelaces of such scholars and scientists
<br>
as Robert Frietas, Eric Drexler, Michael West, Aubrey de Grey, Ralph Merkle,
<br>
Bart Kosko and others.  Perhaps the real stupid person just happens to be...
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;From the John Madden article:
</em><br>
Of course, Hamon, the Ferrells and all the other enraged and disgusted
<br>
people who were closest to Williams don't for a minute think John Henry was
<br>
stupid - or that he really believed his father could one day be brought back
<br>
to life through cryogenics. It is their contention that after squeezing
<br>
every last autograph out of the feeble, critically ill old man, John Henry
<br>
attained his final payday by selling Williams' body to Alcor - which, in
<br>
turn, profited enormously by the publicity. (John Henry, Williams' other
<br>
daughter Claudia and Bobby Jo Ferrell are under a gag order as a result of
<br>
the settlement of Ferrell's lawsuit over Williams' will.)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It shows the bottom line ignorance &amp; apathy of these people that they don't
<br>
even realize the most basic concepts of a cryonics arrangement, due to the
<br>
fact they claim Ted was &quot;sold&quot; to Alcor.
<br>
<p>I just hope government officials and the public realize these people are
<br>
honestly confused (at best) regarding their intentions, and so they should
<br>
not buy into a cry to go after Alcor at its present (and peaceful) Arizona
<br>
home.  We don't need another Dora Kent style cryonics witch hunt...
<br>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that sportswriting in general tends toward
<br>
hyperbole to stir up the reader.  And so when cryonics is brought up don't
<br>
expect things to change in that regard.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
<br>
<p>P.S.  I am currently attempting to assemble the new &quot;professional garden
<br>
cart&quot; purchased by Dave (Dave Pizer, my employer here at Creekside
<br>
Preserve/Ventureville- www.creeksidepreserve.com
<br>
<a href="http://www.venturist.org/">http://www.venturist.org/</a>).  As I slowly make progress I think of the advice
<br>
a friend's dad gave to me when I was a kid &quot;no nut, bolt or piece of
<br>
equipment is smarter than you are!&quot;  I think collectively they just MAY be
<br>
smarter! lol
