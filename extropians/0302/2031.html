<p>&quot;For the very very first time in the 48 years of my life I feel a faint pride
<br>
to be citizen of a nation that does not agree with US aggression all over
<br>
the globe, though it's representatives may surrender at last.&quot;
<br>
<p>Where is all of this future aggression supposed to take place? Do you 
<br>
consider our actions in Afghanistan &quot;US aggression&quot;? Did the people of 
<br>
Afghanistan not benefit from said &quot;aggression&quot;? Why is it not logical to 
<br>
think that the people of Iraq will too?
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Call me what you will or think of me what you will. I will not engage in
<br>
mind games about better or worse superpowers anymore. I am sick of being in
<br>
the position where I must justify my peace loving attitude. This is
<br>
absolutely ridiculous&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not understand this statement. Why do you participate in a discussion 
<br>
forum if you are not willing, or capable, to defend your positions to those 
<br>
with whom you have discussion? There is nothing wrong with having &quot;a peace 
<br>
loving&quot; attitude, my experience on this site leads me to believe it is 
<br>
something shared by everyone on this forum. But by the same token, you cannot 
<br>
blindly dismiss everyone who believes war with Iraq as &quot;war-mongers&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;imperialists&quot;, or any other such empty term. By ridiculing the positions and 
<br>
arguments of those who have differing opinions than you in one sentence 
<br>
sarcastic remarks, you are no better than what you claim them to be.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;All of you, who are so war horny today, YOU (plural) are the ones who should
<br>
ask yourselves if you still have anything to do with transhumanism.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is precisely what I refer to above. &quot;War horny&quot;, come on Hubert, I know 
<br>
you're capable of better than that. The conclusions reached by me, Michael, 
<br>
Ron and others in regard to action in Iraq are not the result of madness, 
<br>
mind control drugs administered by President Bush, or any other such 
<br>
nonsensical explanation. I do not believe that action in Iraq will lead to 
<br>
mass casualties, nor do I believe it will be a long enterprise, at least not 
<br>
in terms of facilitating regime change. There is no evidence to support that 
<br>
it will turn into this horror show that you, Samantha, and others have 
<br>
suggested it will. There is no superpower supplying aid to Iraq, which is 
<br>
precisely the reason that Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan for the Soviets 
<br>
turned into costly (in terms of lives) ventures. I would ask why people who 
<br>
support this enterprise are required to justify why it will not turn into a 
<br>
blood bath but you do not hold yourself and those who share your position to 
<br>
the same standards. Why would this Iraqi effort be any bloodier than the 
<br>
Persian Gulf War? Why would it be more costly in terms of human life than our 
<br>
removal of the Taliban? Where is the evidence to support your assertions?
<br>
<p><p><p>&quot;One of the most original and intelligent minds of this movement - EUGEN 
<br>
LEITL - has
<br>
already unsubscribed extropy list because he could't stand the battle cries
<br>
here on this list any more. This is huge loss for the movement.&quot;
<br>
<p>In what sense? One must be willing to articulate and defend their positions 
<br>
in order to change minds and courses of action. It's not much of a movement 
<br>
if you don't debate with those that have differing opinions than yourself and 
<br>
attempt to change their minds. You're just standing still at that point. 
<br>
Again, your attitude is, if someone's attitude is different than mine, it's 
<br>
just &quot;battle cries.&quot; If Mr. Leitl is unwilling to challenge the positions of 
<br>
others with more than useless labels before retreating in a huff, then I 
<br>
don't see the loss.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;No power has the right to attack a country even if a monster of a dictator
<br>
rules there. The US/UK junta is going to ignite a world fire pretty soon and
<br>
the supporters of war among you know it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, instead of fear mongering, why don't you defend your untenable 
<br>
position with evidence or facts? I know nothing of the sort that &quot;a world 
<br>
fire&quot; is going to ignite. Where? Why hasn't it already, since we removed the 
<br>
Taliban in Afghanistan? The fanatics in Islam are now going to &quot;set on fire&quot; 
<br>
because the US removes a secular Middle Eastern ruler? I could just as easily 
<br>
say, &quot;Sitting on our hands is akin to having a death wish, just as having not 
<br>
acted against the Nazis or the Soviets would have been, and you in the peace 
<br>
movement know it.&quot; Enough with the fire and brimstone rhetoric, let's have 
<br>
some serious debate on this issue.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am no enemy of the USA. I have always looked over the Atlantic and admired
<br>
this great nation and their achievements, but not necessarily their
<br>
governments and their involvements in Indochina.&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't object to you having problems with some of our elected leaders in the 
<br>
past, I certainly do. But again, what is the basis for you objecting to us 
<br>
intervening in Indochina? We didn't attack first, the North Vietnamese were 
<br>
sponsored and armed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, 
<br>
and the government of the Republic of Vietnam requested our assistance. If it 
<br>
was right for us to intervene in World Wars I and II, then it was right for 
<br>
us to intervene in Indochina.
<br>
<p>&quot;And Saddam is a monster whose term of government should be over as soon as 
<br>
possible. Of course. If you think, that US marines will be invading the Iraq 
<br>
and also do it for
<br>
your children in Poland, well, believe it and be satisfied with it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Who believes this? Any action the US takes vis-à-vis Iraq will be in our own 
<br>
national interest, namely our national security. But I can't believe you 
<br>
would argue that the people of Iraq wouldn't benefit from the removal of 
<br>
Saddam Hussein. We didn't act in World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, 
<br>
or any other locale you can think of due to altruism. We did it with the US 
<br>
interests in mind first and foremost. Believe it or not, means and ends can 
<br>
sometimes be complementary.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&quot;But disagreeing with this kind of a preemptive war, the US/UK want to start
<br>
pretty soon, I am expressing my doubts in and my fear of this very special
<br>
sense of mission that the conservative America displays. They send their
<br>
sons to die, do quasi religious nonsense towards their flag, great their War
<br>
Lord Bush and then pray that their realives in New York won't be
<br>
extinguished by a terrorist nuke.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, you simply insult the United States with no evidence. I could just 
<br>
say, &quot;The quasi religious worshipping at the altar of cowardice displayed by 
<br>
Gerhard Schroeder is nauseating&quot; but it wouldn't be any more constructive..
<br>
<p><p>&quot;I am no Old and no New European. I habe been in opposition to German
<br>
government all my life so far. I am sick of politicians, be they old or new,
<br>
European or American. And I do know that the stance of German chancellor
<br>
Gerhard Schroeder towards the Iraq might not emerge from the noblest of
<br>
motives. But I agree with 80 % of the German people that a war on Iraq might
<br>
set the world on fire in a way you have never thought of before.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, given my concerns regarding possible US-Soviet nuclear armageddon from 
<br>
way back when, I cannot imagine the world set on fire in a way worse than that
<br>
…But again, where is the justification for this doomsday scenario?
<br>
<p>&quot;A German expert on Iraq has published a book with the title &quot;Who will be
<br>
crying for Abdul and Tanyana&quot; trying to direct the attention on the misery
<br>
of the civil deaths in Iraq. Think about dead women and children too, when
<br>
you will be proud to have conquered the oil wells with your American marine
<br>
friends&quot;
<br>
<p>As Michael and Ron have so eloquently stated earlier, it doesn't seem anyone 
<br>
is crying for Abdul and Tanyana now. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Ron, when will you ever understand that being highly sceptical about the way
<br>
the US tries to get rid of Sadam does not mean to be a friend of Sadam or an
<br>
enemy of the USA. Do yourself a favour and think in technicolor instead of
<br>
only black and white.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is the pot calling the kettle black. You are suggesting that any action 
<br>
in Iraq will lead to universal armageddon, with no other possible outcome, 
<br>
but Ron is the one thinking in black and white?
<br>
<p><p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
<br>
<p>&quot;At every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with 
<br>
America and little that is right.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
