<p>This subject deserves a bit more consideration, IMHO.
<br>
Remember, these cars that are common in Europe are not available in USA.
<br>
And what is all this litres and kilometres stuff?
<br>
Speak American please, if you want them to understand. ;-)
<br>
<p>1 US gallon =  3.7854 litres or 0.8327 UK gallon.
<br>
1 Litre          = 0.2642 US Gallon
<br>
1 UK gallon = 1.20095  US Gallons
<br>
1 Kilometre = 0.6214 Statute Miles
<br>
<p>As Kia said, in Europe there are many small cars generally available
<br>
that can average around 50 miles per UK gallon and can do 100 miles per
<br>
hour top speed.
<br>
<p>These cars do not use much exotic technology. They are small and light
<br>
in weight and have small (around 1000cc) petrol engines with
<br>
computerised engine management systems. (There are many
<br>
hybrid/diesel/alternative fuels being developed but let's stick to the
<br>
normal 4-stroke IC engines for this discussion).
<br>
<p>In UK petrol costs around 0.77p / litre.
<br>
Assuming 1.65 USD = 1 UKP makes this around 4.81 USD per US gallon. So
<br>
Europeans have a very big incentive to run smaller cars.
<br>
In USA petrol is about one third the price, so Americans have little
<br>
interest in fuel efficient cars at present.
<br>
<p>Now, what is available in USA?
<br>
In USA compact cars and subcompact cars refer to their size overall, not
<br>
to their engine size. So a new VW Beetle with a diesel 1.9 litre engine
<br>
is still called a subcompact car. (This diesel Beetle will average about
<br>
45 mpg, but I'm only looking at standard petrol engine cars).
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/">http://www.fueleconomy.gov/</a>  gives the facts and figures.
<br>
<p>This tells us that there are NO standard petrol engine cars available in
<br>
USA that will average 50 mpg.
<br>
If we drop the average to over 40 mpg, you still get NO standard petrol
<br>
engine cars available in USA. You have to go to hybrid or diesel engines
<br>
to achieve this figure.
<br>
<p>So Americans just don't have the option to buy 50mpg/100mph cars.
<br>
Telling Americans that they should buy our European small cars is a
<br>
waste of  breath if they have no dealers selling them. And US dealers
<br>
are not selling them because subcompact cars have very poor sales
<br>
figures and little interest from the general public.
<br>
<p>From the US point of view there are many disadvantages to small cars, of
<br>
course.
<br>
<p>More people die in small cars than in big cars. (Not by being crushed by
<br>
SUVs as you might think, but by driving into solid objects). The more
<br>
crushable metal surrounding you, the safer you will be. So in USA,
<br>
people in SUVs will tend to live longer.
<br>
<p>Small engines mean a different style of driving. You tend not to burn
<br>
rubber between traffic lights. A small car can cruise at 80 mph on the
<br>
freeway, but it will take some 10-20 seconds longer to reach that speed
<br>
from a standing start. So in USA, you have to get rid of the 'Dukes of
<br>
Hazard' attitude before they will even think about a small car.
<br>
<p>Small cars tend to be noisier than big luxury cars. Thick soundproofing
<br>
and thick carpets add weight, which small cars don't like. That said, in
<br>
normal use, it isn't a problem. Especially if you have your boombox
<br>
blasting out heavy metal rock music.
<br>
<p>Small cars have no room for a gun rack. So, obviously they are out of
<br>
the question for middle America. :-)
<br>
<p>To sum up, even if petrol prices in USA double or triple, it will take
<br>
years before the American public will want small cars and dealers will
<br>
be able to provide them.
<br>
<p>Drive carefully, BillK
