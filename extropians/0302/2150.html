<br>
<p>MSNBC - Researchers who discovered that elderly people with longer
<br>
telomeres lived five to six years longer than people with shorter ones
<br>
think increasing the length of telomeres could be a possible key to a
<br>
longer life. Research into telomeres is still in its early phases but
<br>
scientists believe that increased understanding about telomeres and
<br>
telomerase, an enzyme that strengthens and lengthens them, will improve
<br>
understanding of age-related diseases and the aging process itself....

<br>
<p>New Scientist - Old people can expect to die sooner if they have shorter

telomeres, pieces of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes.
<br>
Researchers have long suspected that telomeres act as molecular clocks

governing the process of ageing in cells, but until now nobody has

proven the link.

Computer Scientist Locates More Than 1,000 Novel Genes In Mouse And Human

<p>Science Daily - Using both the mouse and human genomes, a computer
<br>
scientist at Washington University in St. Louis and international
<br>
collaborators have developed a method for predicting novel genes in both
<br>
genomes. With the method the scientists have discovered 1,019 novel
<br>
genes that are found in both man and mouse. The breakthrough is expected
<br>
to speed up discovery of genes in both genomes as well as those of other
<br>
mammals. Because it is efficient and cost-effective, laboratories are
<br>
likely to use it and pursue genetic studies on a number of major fronts.

<p>BBC - Millions of middle-aged Britons could soon be able to throw away
<br>
their reading glasses. A new treatment, which reverses the damage caused
<br>
to the eyes by ageing, has now become available in this country. The
<br>
painless procedure, called conductive keratoplasty (CK), uses radio

waves to reshape the eye without surgery. The treatment lasts just five
<br>
minutes and costs between Â£1,000 and Â£1,500.

<p>Genome Biology - New research published in Genome Biology investigates
<br>
genes that increase the life span of fruit flies in an effort to gain a
<br>
greater understanding of the ageing process. The researchers from the
<br>
University of Southern California and Harvard Medical School screened
<br>
10,000 fruit fly populations that were mutated. Their results revealed
<br>
that six populations of mutant flies lived 5-17% longer than normal.
<br>
Furthermore, analysis of these long-lived flies showed that the extended
<br>
life span was caused by the overexpression of six different genes.

<p>CANCER Research UK - scientists have found a switch that flicks cancer

<br>
All normal cells eventually stop dividing when they reach a certain age

Short Telomeres Linked to Heart Disease in Mice

<br>
<p>Betterhumans - Mice engineered to have short telomeres have displayed

symptoms consistent with heart disease. The finding suggests that
<br>
shortening of telomeres
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cap chromosomes and get smaller with cell division,
<br>
eventually leading to cell death -- contributes to heart disease in the
<br>
elderly. It also suggests that therapies aimed at lengthening telomeres
<br>
could be effective in treating heart disease, and supports the theory
<br>
that the therapies could address other diseases of aging.

<p>New Scientist - Distributed computing may finally become a useful tool
<br>
in complex problem solving thanks to research in the US that appears to
<br>
overcome its biggest drawback - how to distribute the problem in the
<br>
first place. The idea of distributed, or &quot;grid&quot; computing is to replace
<br>
the need for supercomputers by dividing up very complex tasks and
<br>
distributing the parts to large numbers of cheaper processors, such as
<br>
desktop PCs.

<p>Betterhumans - Offering yet another sign that solar power has matured, a
<br>
division of one of the world's biggest energy companies has announced
<br>
the launch of a complete home solar kit. BP Solar, a division of BP, is
<br>
marketing the kit to California homeowners as a way for power consumers
<br>
to reduce or eliminate electricity bills while opting for cleaner energy.

Tiny Whiskers Make Huge Memory Storage

<p>Newsfactor - New, tiny magnetic sensors could help break a technical
<br>
barrier to ushering in the next generation of computer disk storage
<br>
capacity, researchers reported Friday. The sensors, filaments of nickel
<br>
thinner than a wavelength of visible light, are capable of detecting
<br>
extremely weak magnetic fields. Although it is already possible to
<br>
increase hard drive storage capacity many times, the process has lagged
<br>
because technology has not existed to read the data signals, researcher
<br>
Harsh Chopra, a materials scientist at the State University of New York
<br>
in Buffalo, told United Press International.

<p>Ledger-Enquirer - Freitas envisions a day when tiny nanorobots will
<br>
function as vigorous new blood cells or even repair DNA damaged in the
<br>
normal course of aging, a process he has dubbed chromosome-replacement
<br>
therapy. Such technology would constitute the Fountain of Youth...
