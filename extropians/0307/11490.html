Someone said a while ago they wanted Polari to make a comeback - vada well!

<p>Lavender linguistics
<br>
<p>Back in the 1950s it was the language of the gay community, a secret code
<br>
that could help you pull - and keep you out of prison. Now, writes Liz Gill,
<br>
it's making a comeback
<br>
<p>Monday July 14, 2003
<br>
The Guardian
<br>
<p>Polari: &quot;Ooh vada well the omee-palone ajax who just trolled in - she's got
<br>
nanti taste, dear, cod lally-drags and the naff riah but what a bona eek.
<br>
Fantabulosa!&quot; Translation: &quot;Have a good look at that homosexual nearby who
<br>
just came in. He's got no taste - awful trousers and tasteless hair - but
<br>
what a lovely face. Absolutely fabulous!&quot;
<br>
<p>John Foster would not need the above translation. As a steward in the 1950s
<br>
merchant navy he spoke Polari every day for seven years, at sea and on
<br>
shore. For him and thousands of other gay men it was both a means of
<br>
expression and a protective code.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everything was illegal in those days and you had to be very careful,&quot; he
<br>
recalls. &quot;I always looked straight, I never minced about, so dropping in the
<br>
odd Polari word would be a way of checking the other person out. If you
<br>
liked the look of someone at the theatre, you might say to them, 'That was a
<br>
bona scene, wasn't it?' If they were straight they wouldn't pick up on it
<br>
but if they were gay there might be a shriek of recognition: 'She's camp,
<br>
this one.'&quot;
<br>
<p>Now 72 and a retired electronics supervisor living in Southend, Foster
<br>
rarely speaks Polari apart from the odd word with old friends. Until
<br>
recently it could have been expected to die out with his generation. Today,
<br>
however, there is an upsurge of interest in what has become known as
<br>
&quot;lavender linguistics&quot;. Paul Baker, a lecturer at Lancaster University, has
<br>
been researching the dialect for six years and has written three books on
<br>
the subject, including a dictionary of more than 200 words and phrases.
<br>
<p>&quot;I first heard Polari when the Julian and Sandy tapes from Round the Horne
<br>
were re-released,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought Kenneth Williams and Hugh Paddick
<br>
were incredibly funny but it also seemed extraordinary for them to be using
<br>
this gay slang in a Sunday afternoon family programme back in the 60s. As I
<br>
tried to find out more about this language, I discovered that almost nothing
<br>
had been written down. A piece of history was going to be lost before long
<br>
if we didn't preserve it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ads in the gay press, and &quot;generally making a nuisance of myself everywhere
<br>
I went&quot;, produced nearly two dozen interviewees aged from 50 upwards. &quot;All
<br>
of them remembered it fondly, even proudly. They'd been taught it by older
<br>
men almost as a way of passing down the values of gay subculture from one
<br>
generation to the next. They were also often given camp names, usually
<br>
women's, as if they were being given a new identity and a sense of
<br>
belonging.&quot;
<br>
<p>The origins of Polari probably lie in the 19th-century slang Parlyaree used
<br>
by fairground and circus people, as well as prostitutes and beggars, and it
<br>
also has links to the older vocabularies of other stigmatised groups or
<br>
outsiders such as thieves' cant, cockney rhyming slang, yiddish and the
<br>
lingua franca of sailors. Usage reached its peak in the repressive 1950s
<br>
when being gay was illegal and dangerous: men lived in constant fear of
<br>
blackmail, exposure and the humiliation of electric shock and hormone
<br>
&quot;treatments&quot;, as well as imprisonment. The fact that the spies Guy Burgess
<br>
and Donald Maclean were gay further fuelled public paranoia.
<br>
<p>&quot;A language that protected you and acted as a kind of 'gaydar' was very
<br>
useful,&quot; says Baker. &quot;It was also a way of poking fun at that repressive
<br>
society. Using feminised names like Hilda Handcuffs or Jennifer Justice for
<br>
the police was a way of removing some of their power. Being ironic, blase,
<br>
making a joke was a way of coping. It was also very frank: it had to invent
<br>
words for practices for which there were no heterosexual equivalents.&quot;
<br>
<p>By the 1960s, the political climate had begun to change and Polari became
<br>
less concerned with cautious contact-making, and more about gossiping with
<br>
friends, particularly about potential sexual partners.
<br>
<p>Chris Monk, a 64 year-old former nurse from Chelmsford, learned it in his
<br>
late teens. &quot;It's an age when your brain just soaks up information, but the
<br>
words were generally short and easy to remember anyway. There was something
<br>
joyful about it, and it felt very daring. You could say 'bona cartes' ('good
<br>
cock') in a crowded pub without anyone else twigging.
<br>
<p>&quot;You can be very bitchy in Polari, sometimes just by changing your tone. If
<br>
you say 'vada that eek' in a high-pitched, excited sort of way it's praise;
<br>
if you say it in a slow drawl it's derogatory. But there aren't many words
<br>
for emotions: they had to be kept buttoned up. You made light of your
<br>
feelings because displaying them would attract attention and arouse
<br>
suspicion.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Julian and Sandy sketches were in effect the language's swansong. &quot;They
<br>
rather gave the game away,&quot; says Baker. &quot;What was the point in using Polari
<br>
if Aunt Beryl listened to Round the Horne and was able to get the gist of
<br>
what you were saying?&quot;
<br>
<p>The fact that there was no great outcry - indeed the show drew audiences of
<br>
nine million at its height - also suggested that the climate was changing.
<br>
In 1967 the recommendations of the Wolfenden report were implemented and
<br>
homosexuality largely decriminalised. The removal of the need for secrecy
<br>
was followed by a backlash against the old camp stereotypes.
<br>
<p>&quot;The gay liberation movement saw a swing to the other extreme,&quot; says Baker.
<br>
&quot;Everything had to be very masculine and butch, so a generation gap
<br>
developed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Today, however, there is increasing interest among gays in their cultural
<br>
background. When the Brighton-based organisation Glam (Gay and Lesbian Arts
<br>
and Media) held a Polari event recently they expected only older men to turn
<br>
up. In fact, says Joan Beveridge, &quot;it was interesting to see how many young
<br>
men in their 20s came. It was as if they wanted to acknowledge the
<br>
historical element in their community and that something like Polari helped
<br>
form it.
<br>
<p>&quot;Some people say, why bother if it's lost, we don't need it now, we're all
<br>
accepted. Others argue that it's part of our history - and besides,
<br>
circumstances can change and one day a secret language might be needed
<br>
again.&quot;
