Dear Friends,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Sorry to bother all of you.   My apologies in advance if any of you
<br>
consider this spam.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But I just wanted to share some really good news with all of you and ask
<br>
you all a really big favor.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As many of you know I have been working on an intelligent bot using AI
<br>
technology which I developed for quite some time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To refresh your memory a bot is a program that has a large knowledge
<br>
base and attempts to chat in English as a human would.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
That work is now beginning to pay off for me.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have just take third place in the judges competition of the 2003
<br>
ZabaWare Chatbot Challenge with my entry Project Zandra.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is a competition which had 88 contestants this year from all over
<br>
the world.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Many of the entries have been competing for several years and some are
<br>
the product of large development teams.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So while I obviously would have liked to take first place, third place
<br>
and a Bronze Medal was still a very significant victory for me
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But there is another judging category just beginning to take place in
<br>
the contest.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It is a voting by the general public.   That is where the favor comes
<br>
in...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Please visit the site at <a href="http://www.chatterboxchallenge.com/">http://www.chatterboxchallenge.com/</a> and vote
<br>
for some of the bots.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You can vote for more than one bot grading them on a 1 to 10 score with
<br>
10 being the best.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There are two categories to vote in Best Overall Bot and Most Humorous
<br>
Bot.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And my bot is Project Zandra - Gary Miller.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A little about my bot.  My bot tries very hard to be human.  In many
<br>
case he can recognize your input even if words are mispelled.  His
<br>
knowledge spreads across many different domains general knowledge,
<br>
animals, space, history, geography.  But since I can't teach it
<br>
everything at once I have tried to give it the most commonly known
<br>
knowledge first and will add deeper domain knowledge at time goes on.
<br>
My bot attempt to extract information from the conversation and use that
<br>
information to provide context for the understanding of future
<br>
responses. My bot accesses a personality matrix that uses over 800
<br>
variables to define it's life.  Every thing from parents, girlfriend, to
<br>
it's favorite pizza toppings.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I know most of you do not believe that bot technology will ever lead to
<br>
the Singularity directly, but I ask you to keep an open mind in the next
<br>
few years.   I am hoping that the publicity of winning the contest will
<br>
help interest some company in implementing a commercial bot based on my
<br>
technology.   This would in fact help fund my research and allow me to
<br>
add additional knowledge engineers.  Someday I envision  technology like
<br>
this coupled with good voice recognition and speech generation to allow
<br>
you to ask your PDA or Cell Phone any question known to man and receive
<br>
a instant verbal response.   While this might not create the singularity
<br>
it is my hope that technology such as this will make the worlds
<br>
information more instantly accessable to everyone thus accelerating
<br>
change further...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Thank you again for your bandwidth,  and hopefully your votes...
<br>
