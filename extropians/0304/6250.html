<p>&quot;The Future Boundaries of Personhood: Evolving Technological, Legal, and
<br>
Ethical Definitions&quot;
<br>
<p>As barriers between the species and man/machine begin to blur and blend, how
<br>
will these affect legal and ethical notions of &quot;personhood&quot;?
<br>
<p>Linda MacDonald Glenn, LLM is currently a senior fellow at the Institute for
<br>
Ethics at the American Medical Association. Her thesis was entitled,
<br>
&quot;Biotechnology At The Margins of Personhood: An Evolving Legal Paradigm.&quot;
<br>
Prior to returning to an academic setting, she consulted and practiced as a
<br>
trial attorney with an emphasis in patient advocacy, bioethical and
<br>
biotechnology issues, end of life decision-making, reproductive rights,
<br>
genetics, parental/biological &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot;, and animal rights
<br>
issues. She was the lead attorney in several &quot;cutting edge&quot; bioethics legal
<br>
cases, including Gray v. Romeo (697 F.Supp. 580, District of Rhode Island,
<br>
1988). She has advised governmental leaders and agencies, published numerous
<br>
articles in professional journals, and has a book chapter in Nursing
<br>
Malpractice: Sidestepping Legal Minefields (Lippincott, Williams, and
<br>
Wilkins Publishers, 2002.). She has taught at the University of Vermont
<br>
School of Nursing and the Community College of Vermont, and addressed public
<br>
and professional groups internationally. Her extensive experience and
<br>
passion for the issues facing the legal and medical professions make her a
<br>
compelling and thought-provoking lecturer. Her current research areas
<br>
encompass End-of-Life Care and evolving notions of personhood.

<br>
<p>&quot;Offensive Transhumanist Ethics&quot;
<br>
<p>Transhumanists often defend their ethical position &quot;defensively&quot; in terms of
<br>
rights, e.g., it is sometimes claimed that we have the right to modify our
<br>
bodies as we see fit. I argue that this concedes far too much to our
<br>
opponents, and seriously underestimates the promise of transhumanism.  I
<br>
offer a more &quot;offensive&quot; view: we have a duty to employ technology for the
<br>
purpose of improving ourselves.
<br>
<p>Dr. Walker is the Editor of the Journal of Evolution and Technology, and a
<br>
research fellow of the Department of Philosophy of Trinity College,
<br>

<p>Nick Bostrom Ph.D.

<br>
<p>&quot;Our Human and Posthuman Dignity&quot;
<br>
<p>Opponents of transhumanism sometimes appeal to the idea of human dignity as
<br>
a ground for resisting proposals to use technology to modify human nature.
<br>
Genetic engineering, life-extension technology, psychopharmacology, and
<br>
anticipated future technologies such as nanomedicine and artificial
<br>
intelligence, are seen as threatening to undermine our human dignity. I
<br>
argue that these objections to human enhancement rest on a narrow and
<br>
misguided understanding of what human dignity is. Technology has already
<br>
changed humanity profoundly. Our lives, concerns, abilities, thoughts,
<br>
beliefs, and activities are vastly different from those of our
<br>
&quot;technologically naked&quot; ancestors of a hundred thousand years ago. In this
<br>
sense, we are already transhumans. Yet these developments have not made us
<br>
less human. Rather, the use of technology to expand our human capacities and
<br>
to develop ourselves in accordance with our ideals can be seen as a central
<br>
aspect of our humanity. Furthermore, it would be naive to suppose that we
<br>
have reached the endpoint of this long process of human self-transformation.
<br>
It is much more likely, provided a species-destroying catastrophe is
<br>
avoided, that we will one day in a not so distant future use technology to
<br>
make ourselves posthumans beings with much longer lifespan, and vastly
<br>
greater intellectual, emotional, physical and spiritual capacities than any
<br>
currant human. This transhumanist perspective, I argue, suggests a different
<br>
idea of human dignity and a family of ethical principles to go with it. We
<br>
need to expand our concept of dignity to encompass also posthuman dignity,
<br>
and we need to apply this broader concept when evaluating possible
<br>
directions of current technological developments.
<br>
<p>Dr. Bostrom founded the World Transhumanist Association, and is one of
<br>
principal expositors of transhumanist philosophy. He is author of Anthropic
<br>
Bias: Observation Selection Effects in Science and Philosophy. Dr. Bostrom

<br>
<p>&quot;Meeting the Challenge: Safe Utilization of Advanced Nanotechnology&quot;
<br>
<p>One of the postulated results of advanced nanotechnology is molecular
<br>
manufacturing. If achieved, this could result in a world filled with
<br>
billions of desktop-size nanofactories that manufacture almost anything in
<br>
just a few hours. The first step in building a nanofactory is building an
<br>
assembler. Once a basic assembler has been completed, it can begin the job
<br>
of constructing a nanofactory. The blueprint will already be in place.
<br>
Common wisdom says that progress from today's nanotechnology to an assembler
<br>
to a nanofactory will be very slow. However, research by CRN suggests that
<br>
the span of time from first assembler to first nanofactory could be measured
<br>
in weeks. Nanofactories can then begin making products, including other
<br>
nanofactories. The combination of rapid prototyping and simple CAD programs
<br>
for product design will enable unprecedented levels of innovation and
<br>
development. Resulting economic, environmental, and social changes worldwide
<br>
could be extremely disruptive. The price for safe introduction of
<br>
nanofactory technology is thorough, conscientious preparation.
<br>

lives in Brooklyn, New York. Within his adult life, Treder has been a
<br>
husband, a father, a truck driver, a teacher, a salesman, a radio station
<br>
manager, a website developer, an actor, and a vocational counselor for

<br>
the transhumanist movement. Treder serves on the Boards of Directors of the
<br>
Human Futures Institute and the World Transhumanist Association, and is a
<br>
member of the Executive Advisory Team for the Extropy Institute. He is
<br>
Executive Director of the New York Transhumanist Association, developer of
<br>
the Incipient Posthuman website, and is listed as a &quot;Big Thinker&quot; on
<br>
KurzweilAI.net. In 2002, Treder co-founded the Center for Responsible
<br>
Nanotechnology (CRN) with Chris Phoenix. CRN is a non-profit organization
<br>
working to raise awareness of the issues presented by advanced
<br>
nanotechnology: the benefits and dangers, and the possibilities for
<br>
responsible use. Treder is Executive Director of CRN.

<br>
<p>&quot;Is there 'human nature' after 'nature-nurture'? A developmental systems
<br>
approach&quot;
<br>
<p>Many biological theorists seek to replace the problematic &quot;nature-nurture&quot;
<br>
dichotomy with the concept of a &quot;developmental system&quot;: the set of all
<br>
reliably occurring structures (genetic, cellular, ecological, etc.) that
<br>
contribute to ontogeny. I explore some implications of developmental systems
<br>
theory for traditional notions of human nature, in light of transhumanist
<br>
concerns.
<br>
<p>Dr. Austin Dacey works for the Center for Inquiry, a think tank based near
<br>
SUNY-Buffalo, where he is a visiting research professor of philosophy. He
<br>
serves as director of educational programs and executive editor of Philo, a

<p>&quot;Primo (3M+) Posthuman&quot;
<br>
<p>Engineering a new human body genre will happen, but not in one fall swoop.
<br>
This new genre, &quot;Primo (3M+) Posthuman,&quot; will occur sequentially by
<br>
replacing the human body bit by bit. Despite the fact that &quot;Primo&quot; is a huge
<br>
undertaking, the sequential process is already taking place. From electronic
<br>
prosthetics and cochlear implants to neurological pharmaceuticals, we are
<br>
replacing the human form, its skeletal system and the brain, with innovative
<br>
technologies that will improve the vulnerability of the body and mental
<br>
processes. Engineering programmable blood, respiratory and digestive
<br>
systems, and building a human-like frame comprised of nanobots, are just a
<br>
few of the possibilities. Our emotions, the guidepost for our human
<br>
evolution, will undergo successive upgrades for enhanced interactive sensory
<br>
experiences with other transhumans and nonbiological machine intelligence.

<p>&quot;Strategies for Workplace Disability Integration: a New Model of Universal

<br>
<p>Current strategies for workplace accommodation either make use of
<br>
specialized assistive technologies or, more recently, environments designed
<br>
to permit &quot;universal&quot; access and use. Both strategies have serious

external environment to a reconfiguration of the users of and within that
<br>
environment.

<p>With average human lifespans nearly doubling in the past century, one might

think the question of immortality had been answered by now. Yet, we're still

grappling with this seemingly simple, exceedingly thorny issue. Scientist
<br>
fear to tread near the topic for fear of cook labels and religious

immortality?

<p>&quot;Body, self and environment as constructed and reconstructed: Insights from
<br>
Buddhist philosophy for the ethics of the future transhuman and posthuman&quot;
<br>
<p>When we are constructed and reconstructed, from new developments in
<br>
biotechnology and information technology as say clone or robot or admixtures
<br>
of both, deep questions are raised that challenge existing ethical systems.
<br>
Dominant Western ethical systems are derived from Christianity, Judaism or
<br>
Islam (the latter included as part of the larger Western &quot;Abrahamaic&quot; family
<br>
of religions); the ethical system being &quot;revealed&quot; and to be &quot;God's word&quot;.
<br>
New developments from abortion, to cloning and in the future, artificial
<br>
genes and artificial chromosomes challenge some of these ethical
<br>
assumptions. Recent approaches to the living world and the environment have
<br>
utilized cultural elements from major non-Western philosophies as well as
<br>
those of simpler belief systems. A major cultural approach that has change
<br>
as its core is Buddhist philosophy. Some core Buddhist approaches have
<br>
direct relevance to a future where both the human and his/her environment is
<br>
constructed and reconstructed. The paper describes the central Buddhist
<br>
position on both the human person, including his body and mind, as well as
<br>
the environment he operates in, as not given or sacred but constructed and
<br>
changing. The paper suggests that an orientation from this core Buddhist
<br>
perspective of continuous change, no permanent self and both human and
<br>
nature as constructed would fit better as a cultural orientation to examine
<br>
and live in a future world under continuous change and where man and nature
<br>
are continuously reinvented and reconstructed. It also suggests that
<br>
Buddhist ethics derived from such a perspective (which unlike the revealed
<br>
religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam is not absolute but contingent
<br>
and situational) may better fit as a means of navigating the coming
<br>
interconnected world of the clone, the robot and the cyborg. The paper
<br>
describes what such an ethical perspective could be and its implications for
<br>
a transhuman and posthuman society.

<p>&quot;The Global Geopolitics towards Transhumanism and Beyond&quot;
<br>
<p>According to the UN, the average European cow receives more in subsidies
<br>
than an African farmer earns to feed his or her family. This is a terrible
<br>
situation that makes progress toward transhumanist ideas difficult in the
<br>
current world context. Will humanity survive its present dilemmas up to the
<br>
point in which transhumanity becomes a reality? A quick review of world
<br>
development with a millennial perspective serves of introduction to what
<br>
might happen in the next few decades. Demographic, economic and scientific
<br>
forecasts will also be presented, taking into consideration the current
<br>
accelerating trends. Technological change is incorporated into the analysis,
<br>
from the printing machine to biotechnology. A view from the developing world
<br>
is a fundamental part of this global picture if the whole of humanity is
<br>
going to make it to some sort of &quot;singularity&quot; threshold. Major countries
<br>
like China and India, the former with biotechnology and the second with
<br>
computer science, for example, are making impressive advances in new fields
<br>
that will be fundamental in the future. Even small countries like Singapore
<br>
or Costa Rica are ahead in some areas of the scientific race for a better
<br>
world. For better or for worse, the weight of strong or weak States, large
<br>
or small countries, rich or poor nations should not be underestimated. The
<br>
risks of overlooking these geopolitical factors open the frightening
<br>
possibility of another Hitler, Stalin or Osama Bin Laden. Transhumanity can
<br>
only become an utopia if we avoid dystopian global scenarios.

<p>&quot;Emerging Life Extension Therapies&quot;
<br>
<p>I will present an overview of life extension, with practical advice for
<br>
today, subjects to follow in the near future, and some dreams worth paying
<br>
attention to. Life extension, one patient at a time, has been the goal of
<br>
medicine since its very beginning but for the most part, only persons with
<br>
identifiable pathological conditions could hope to benefit from therapy. In
<br>
the last few decades, however, a small mumber of pharmacological treatments
<br>
has been developed, which appear to prolong survival of healthy humans by
<br>
preventing many of the deadly conditions associated with aging, such as
<br>
stroke, or myocardial infarction. These drugs include statins, ACE
<br>
inhibitors, aspirin, as well as possibly some other compounds, and are
<br>
available today. For the near future, the progress in elucidating the cause
<br>
of aging gives us for the first time in history some hope of directly
<br>
influencing the rate of aging, perhaps by mitofection, caloric restriction,
<br>
and stem cell therapy. And, last but not least, there are even more daring
<br>
approaches on the far horizon, such as cryonics, and uploading, offering the
<br>
distant but so tempting vision of freedom from aging, the fulfilment an
<br>
age-old dream.

<br>
<p>&quot;Foreseeable, radical life extension: the biology to inform the philosophy&quot;
<br>
<p>Anti-aging biotechnology is far closer than most biologists realise: in ten
<br>
years we should be able to treble the remaining healthy life expectancy of a
<br>
late-middle-aged mouse that has received no treatment before that age. I
<br>
will discuss the biology underlying this claim and its present-day
<br>
sociological and ethical implications.
<br>
<p>Aubrey de Grey is a biogerontologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. He
<br>
designs interventions to reverse (not just retard) the cellular and
<br>
molecular changes that accumulate with age and reduce remaining life
<br>
expectancy (i.e., cause aging). He has coined the term &quot;strategies for
<br>
engineered negligible senescence&quot; (SENS) to describe these interventions,
<br>
which he has argued are the only feasible way to extend human lifespan by
<br>
more than a decade. He has published widely on such technology (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/AdGpubs.htm">http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/sens/AdGpubs.htm</a>). He is holding a major conference
<br>
on such technologies in Cambridge, UK on September 19-23, 2003 (see

<p>&quot;Reproductive Rights, Designer Babies, and the Consent of the Unborn&quot;
<br>
<p>State enforced limitations of human reproductive options in the 21st century
<br>
will need to be considered neugenic and dysgenic. Assisted reproductive
<br>
technologies and the advent of `designer babies' are a legitimate
<br>
reproductive option that will require monitoring and regulation. Parents
<br>
have the consent of the unborn to commit their genome to these changes, and
<br>
an ethical imperative to do so is forthcoming.
<br>
<p>George Dvorsky is the Deputy Editor of Betterhumans and author of the
<br>
Transitory Human column. He is also a co-founder and the Vice-President of
<br>
the Toronto Transhumanist Association. Primarily concerned with the ethical
<br>
and sociological impacts of Transhumanism and future technologies, George
<br>
actively promotes informative, honest and open discussion for the purposes
<br>
of education. George writes and speaks on a wide range of topics, including

<p>Michael Anissimov
<br>
Co-Director, Immortality Institute for Infinite Lifespans
<br>
<p>&quot;Accelerating Progress and the Potential Consequences of Smarter than Human
<br>
Intelligence&quot;
<br>
<p>According to a growing group of prominent futurists and academics,
<br>
exponentially accelerating trends in nano-, cognitive, and computer sciences
<br>
will create a technological environment conducive to the creation of
<br>
genuinely smarter than human intelligence by the middle of this century.
<br>
This presentation will review the technologies currently moving in this
<br>
direction, state how these technologies might be applied to the creation of
<br>
transhuman intelligence, analyze the possible consequences of such an
<br>
advance, and suggest actions that transhumanists can take to raise the
<br>
probability of a positive outcome.
<br>
<p>Born in 1984, Michael Anissimov is a co-director of the nonprofit
<br>
Immortality Institute for Infinite Lifespans, an organization devoted to

<p>Anatoly Nichvoloda
<br>
Associate, Internatura Think Tank
<br>
<p>&quot;System Completion Theory: from Local to Global Consciousness-Humans, AI and
<br>
Beyond&quot;
<br>
<p>System Completion Theory describes evolution and role of Human Consciousness
<br>
and conscious AI systems in the context of evolution of the Universe by
<br>
identifying them as a Converging (local) Consciousness en route to Diverging
<br>
(global) Consciousness.
<br>
<p>Anatoly Nichvoloda received his Master's degrees in Journalism and
<br>
Philosophy with minor in Psychology from Dnepropetrovsk State University,
<br>
Ukraine in 1996. Anatoly Nichvoloda received his Bachelor's Degree in
<br>
Marketing/Advertising from the University of Oklahoma, Norman in 2000. In
<br>
1998 he joined &quot;Internatura&quot; think tank under the auspices of St. Petersburg
<br>
State University, Russia. The goals of this organization include development
<br>
of the systematic description of our reality and role of Human Consciousness
<br>
in it. Anatoly developed System Completion Theory coauthoring it with
<br>
professor Victor Tolkachev. This theory lays out the structure of Human
<br>
Consciousness, its role and function in the Universe. Theory suggests that
<br>
main organizational and functioning principles of Human Consciousness will
<br>
serve as the foundation for future AI systems. Anatoly Nichvoloda is
<br>
currently a PhD student and a contributing writer/speaker to &quot;Internatura&quot;
<br>
think tank. In December 2002 Anatoly joined New York Transhumanism
<br>
Association and has been an active participant and a presenter.

<br>
<p>&quot;Mainstreaming Offensive: Making Transhumanism the Next Big Thing&quot;
<br>
<p>Some propose that Transhumanism is inherently offensive to most
<br>
sensibilities and that it could never become a mainstream movement without
<br>
weakening what makes it valuable and unique. This presentation argues that
<br>
Transhumanism can become the Next Big Thing.

TransCentral, Chicago Transhumanist Association
<br>
<p>&quot;Organizing Campus Transhumanist Groups and an International Facilitation
<br>
Network&quot;
<br>
<p>This proposal to create an international facilitation network for the
<br>
organization of campus transhumanist groups finds its justification in the
<br>
need to continually engage young generations in transhumanist dialog in
<br>
order to undo the hegemony of the bio-conservative political establishment,
<br>
to catalyze sympathetic students, and to educate communities of learning
<br>
about transhumanist issues and ideas. A number of options for implementation
<br>
of the network will be offered, as well as perspectives on key resources,
<br>
target cultures, specific v. broad groups, inclusive involvement, local
<br>
chapter support, advocacy, a rough timeline, and a wish list to which the
<br>
audience may add suggestions.

<p>&quot;Development after De Chardin: The Accelerating Transhumanist Frontier&quot;
<br>
<p>Will accelerating change ever slow down? What cosmological, computational,
<br>
information theoretic, or systems theory interpretations have been proposed
<br>
for this phenomenon? We'll explore the latest literature and informed
<br>
speculations on these topics, and consider what increasingly autocatalytic
<br>
technological change might mean to transhumanists, futurists, and
<br>
singularity-unaware society in coming years.
<br>
<p>John Smart is chairman of the Institute for Accelerating Change, a nonprofit
<br>
