Article below is derived from the National Post and a
<br>
number of other sources -- but I found the history lesson
<br>
quite informative (though I will not assert its accuracy).
<br>
<p>Makes one wonder a *lot* about why the French and the
<br>
Germans resist change in Iraq.  If the article is
<br>
accurate they (or their parents) are the &quot;people&quot;
<br>
indirectly responsible for the mess.  One wouldn't
<br>
want to expose the dirty linen.
<br>
<p>Of course this wouldn't have happened if the French
<br>
and British had taken the rise of Hitler/Nazism more
<br>
seriously and been prepared for it.  (The U.S. cannot
<br>
be totally blameless as I think during that period
<br>
[the '30s] we wanted no part of Euopean internal
<br>
politics.)
<br>
<p>Definitely points out the long term consequences
<br>
of sticking ones head in the sand.

&quot;SADDAM'S REGIME IS A EUROPEAN IMPORT&quot;
<br>
<p>From National Post 10 April 2003
<br>
<a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/commentary/story.html?id=%7B0E39D93C-7FF7-43A9-9E5DA0E7EF4CF6C4%7D">http://www.nationalpost.com/commentary/story.html?id=%7B0E39D93C-7FF7-43A9-9E5DA0E7EF4CF6C4%7D</a>

By Bernard Lewis
<br>
<p>In the Western world, knowledge of history is poor -- and the
<br>
awareness of history is frequently poorer. For example, people
<br>
often argue today as if the kind of political order that prevails
<br>
in Iraq is part of the immemorial Arab and Islamic tradition. This
<br>
is totally untrue. The kind of regime represented by Saddam Hussein
<br>
has no roots in either the Arab or Islamic past. Rather, it is an
<br>
ideological importation from Europe -- the only one that worked and
<br>
succeeded (at least in the sense of being able to survive).
<br>
<p>In 1940, the French government accepted defeat and signed a
<br>
separate peace with the Third Reich. The French colonies in Syria
<br>
and Lebanon remained under Vichy control, and were therefore open
<br>
to the Nazis to do what they wished. They became major bases for
<br>
Nazi propaganda and activity in the Middle East. The Nazis extended
<br>
their operations from Syria and Lebanon, with some success, to Iraq
<br>
and other places. That was the time when the Baath Party was
<br>
founded, as a kind of clone of the Nazi and Fascist parties, using
<br>
very similar methods and adapting a very similar ideology, and
<br>
operating in the same way -- as part of an apparatus of
<br>
surveillance that exists under a one-party state, where a party is
<br>
not a party in the Western democratic sense, but part of the
<br>
apparatus of a government. That was the origin of the Baath Party.
<br>
<p>When the Third Reich collapsed, and after an interval was replaced
<br>
by the Soviet Union as the patron of all anti-Western forces, the
<br>
adjustment from the Nazi model to the Communist model was not very
<br>
difficult and was carried throughout without problems. That is
<br>
where the present Iraqi type of government comes from. As I said
<br>
before, it has no roots in the authentic Arabic or Islamic past. It
<br>
is, instead, part of the most successful and most harmful process
<br>
of Westernization to have occurred in the Middle East.
<br>
<p>When Westernization failed in the Middle East, this failure was
<br>
followed by a redefinition and return to older, more deep-rooted
<br>
perceptions of self and other. I mean, of course, religion.
<br>
<p>Religion had several advantages. It was more familiar. It was more
<br>
readily intelligible. It could be understood immediately by
<br>
Muslims. Nationalist and socialist slogans, by contrast, needed
<br>
explanation. Religion was less impeded. What I mean is that even
<br>
the most ruthless of dictatorships cannot totally suppress
<br>
religiously defined opposition. In the mosques, people can meet and
<br>
speak. In most fascist-style states, openly meeting and speaking
<br>
are rigidly controlled and repressed. This is not possible in
<br>
dealing with Islam. Islamic opposition movements can use a language
<br>
familiar to all, and, through mosques, can tap into a network of
<br>
communication and organization.
<br>
<p>This gave to religious arguments a very powerful advantage. In
<br>
fact, dictatorships were even helping them by eliminating competing
<br>
oppositions. They had another great advantage in competing with
<br>
democratic movements. Such movements must allow freedom of
<br>
expression, even to those who are opposed to them. Those who are
<br>
opposed to them are under no such obligation. Indeed, their very
<br>
doctrines require them to suppress what they see as impious and
<br>
immoral ideas -- an unfair advantage in this political competition.
<br>
<p>These religious movements have another advantage. They can invoke
<br>
the very traditional definition of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot; that exists
<br>
in the Islamic world. It is very old. We see it, for example, in
<br>
historiography. We can talk of European history as a struggle
<br>
against, for example, the Moors, or the Tartars. If you look at
<br>
contemporary historiography for the Middle East's Muslim peoples,
<br>
their struggle is always defined in religious terms. For their
<br>
historians, their side is Islam, their ruler is the lord of Islam,
<br>
and the enemy is defined as infidels. That earlier classification
<br>
has come back again. Osama bin Laden's habit of defining his
<br>
enemies as &quot;crusaders&quot; illustrates this. By &quot;crusaders,&quot; bin Laden
<br>
does not mean Americans or Zionists. &quot;Crusaders,&quot; of course, were
<br>
Christian warriors in a holy war for Christendom, fighting to
<br>
recover the holy places of Christendom, which had been lost to
<br>
Muslim conquerors in the 7th century. Bin Laden sees it as a
<br>
struggle between two rival religions.
<br>
<p>I say again: To blame the Saddam Hussein-type governments on
<br>
Islamic and Arabic traditions is totally false. Those traditions
<br>
led to the development of societies that, while not democratic in
<br>
the sense of having elected bodies, produced limited governments.
<br>
That is, governments limited by the holy law, limited in a
<br>
practical sense by the existence of powerful groups in society,
<br>
like the rural gentry and the military and religious
<br>
establishments. These acted as constraints on the power of the
<br>
government. The idea of absolute rule is totally alien to Islamic
<br>
practice until, sad to say, modernization made it possible.
<br>
<p>What the process of modernization did was to strengthen the
<br>
sovereign power, and place at the disposal of the sovereign power
<br>
the whole modern apparatus of control and repression. Modernization
<br>
also weakened the intermediate powers, which previously limited the
<br>
powers of the state and had acted as a countervailing force.
<br>
Modernization meant a shift from old elites living on their
<br>
estates, to new elites who regarded the state as their estate.
<br>
<p>Modernization has not erased the fact that the peoples of the
<br>
Muslim Middle East have a tradition of limited, responsible
<br>
government. While not democratic, this tradition shares many
<br>
features of democratic Western governments. It provides, I believe,
<br>
a good basis for the development of democratic institutions -- as
<br>
has happened elsewhere in the world. I remain cautiously optimistic
<br>
for their future.
