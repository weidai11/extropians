<p>Breakthrough Brings Laser Light To New Regions Of The Spectrum. Combining
<br>
concepts from electromagnetic radiation research and fiber optics,
<br>
researchers have created an extreme-ultraviolet, laser-like beam capable of
<br>
producing tightly-focused light in a region of the electromagnetic spectrum
<br>
not previously accessible to scientists. Between 10-100 times shorter than
<br>
visible light waves, the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths will allow
<br>
researchers to &quot;see&quot; tiny features and carve miniature patterns, with
<br>
applications in such fields as microscopy, lithography and nanotechnology.

Dear Mr. President: I must respectfully decline your invitation, as I am
<br>
unsuited to such a role, but I wish to take this opportunity to offer a
<br>
potentially crucial piece of advice regarding strategic research directions.
<br>
The United States, like all the leading technological powers, has recently
<br>
turned its research efforts toward a broad field called &quot;nanotechnology&quot;. I
<br>
introduced this term in the mid-1980s and described long-term prospects that
<br>
helped motivate the recent explosion of interest and investment. (The Edge

<p>Researchers in industry and academia tinker with self-repairing systems,

molecular circuits and more. The customarily languid pace at which
<br>
scientific research blossoms into practical applications appeared to speed
<br>
up this year with a number of discoveries being rushed toward
<br>
commercialization. Autonomic computing, in which systems can configure and
<br>
repair themselves, took a big leap forward when Pennsylvania State
<br>
University researchers said they had developed software that can repair--on
<br>
the fly--an attacked database while allowing it to continue processing
<br>
transactions. (ZDnet 12/30/02)

<p>Chemical attraction solves geometric puzzles. Circuit builders could
<br>
capitalize on self-assembling floating patterns. Chop up a square into four
<br>
pieces, and reassemble them into a triangle. This kind of geometric
<br>
dissection puzzle delighted ancient Chinese scholars. Chemists have now
<br>
created self-solving dissections. Their trick could help in building
<br>
easy-to-modify circuits. George Whitesides of Harvard University in
<br>
Cambridge, Massachusetts, and colleagues design the edges of floating
<br>
polygonal shapes so that they stick together in a particular arrangement.

<p>Nanotechnology makes Smallbany the place to be...nanotechnology may well
<br>
make Albany a hot spot. Nanotechnology is the creation and use of materials,
<br>
devices and systems that are formed through the control of matter at the
<br>
nanometer-length level. A nanometer is 75,000 times smaller than the width
<br>
of a human hair. In the 21st century, nanotechnology is expected to change

everything. It may certainly give new meaning to the phrase Smallbany.

<p>Nanoimprint lithography ready to make its mark. A potentially low-cost form
<br>
of lithography affectionately known as &quot;squish and flash&quot; by its backers is
<br>
coming to market. Three vendors have announced or released tools for the
<br>
technique, properly known as nanoimprint lithography. And the concept has
<br>
garnered enough interest among research entities in the United States,
<br>
Europe and Japan to have warranted its own conference this month. Imprint
<br>
lithography uses polymers that harden into patterns when exposed to
<br>
ultraviolet light through a 1:1 proximity mask. The patterns on the template
<br>
are written with an electron-beam system at the same line width as the
<br>
pattern on the wafer, rather than at the 4x reduction possible with
<br>
conventional optical lithography. Molecular Imprints Inc. (MII), based here,
<br>
next month will ship a development tool, the Imprio 100, with a $2 million
<br>
price tag, said CEO Norm Schumaker. Nanonex Corp. (Princeton, N.J.) is
<br>
shipping nanoimprint lithography tools that range in price from $300,000 to
<br>
$700,000. (EE Times 12/20/02)

<p>(AI) Composer harnesses artificial intelligence to create music. Just as
<br>
IBM's Deep Blue showed the world a computer can play chess as well as a
<br>
human master, Eduardo Reck Miranda, a researcher for the Sony Computer
<br>
Science Laboratories Inc., aims to demonstrate a computer program able to
<br>
compose original music. So far, neural networks have succeeded in imitating
<br>
distinct musical styles, but truly original compositions have remained
<br>
elusive. Miranda is tackling that problem with an orchestra of virtual
<br>
musicians - called agents - that interact to compose original music.

<p>The Incredible Shrinking Technology. Nanotechnology used to be a playground
<br>
for speculation and science fiction. It is now one of the most exciting
<br>
research fields in contemporary science. It is true that nanotechnology has
<br>
been heralded as the &quot;next big thing&quot; for years and the excitement
<br>
surrounding it certainly increased after the dot com bubble burst and people
<br>
started looking for another wonder technology. Nevertheless, despite the
<br>
hype, big strides have been taken and more are imminent. Nanotechnology is
<br>
an umbrella term for approaches from different scientific disciplines which
<br>
share the defining element of operating within the very small world of
<br>
molecules, where distances are measured in nanometres, or millionths of a
<br>
millimetre. The computer industry has already entered the nanoworld. Chip
<br>
production operates with features as small as 100 nanometres, and they are
<br>
getting smaller. But can this success be extended to other fields? will
<br>
there be houses, cars, space stations built by manipulation on the nanometre
<br>
scale? -6pg length review.

<p>Tuning Carbon Nanotube Resonance Frequencies. Tuning carbon nanotube

resonance frequencies can be achieved by varying a static voltage applied
<br>
between the nanotubes and a counter electrode. This was demonstrated for

several nanotubes (NT) grown on a nickel support tip. The natural resonant
<br>
NT frequencies are those where the NT oscillates with a large amplitude, a

motion that can be monitored directly by watching the pattern of electrons

<p>The good of small things. Living cells are natural nanotechnology.
<br>
Artificial nanotech is about to give them a helping hand. Nanotechnology is
<br>
a word that seems to mean all things to all men. All it is, however, is
<br>
technology on a &quot;nano&quot; scale: ie, employing devices with dimensions measured
<br>
in nanometres (billionths of a metre). Since that is the scale of large
<br>
molecules, many cynics regard it as merely a fancy name for chemistry. The
<br>
inventor of the term, Eric Drexler, then an engineer at the Massachusetts
<br>
Institute of Technology, had greater ambitions. In &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;, a
<br>
book published in 1986, he argued that it would be possible one day to
<br>
construct self-replicating &quot;nanomachines&quot; that could assemble atoms into
<br>
molecules, thus building new objects from the inside out. (Econimist.com

<p>Small Worlds. Nanotechnology wins over mainstream venture capitalists.
<br>
Nanotechnology is coming in from the fringe. Once dismissed as just so much
<br>
science fiction and Silicon Valley hokum, nanotechnology now represents no
<br>
less than the next industrial revolution. &quot;If you're looking for analogies
<br>
to put the impact of nanotech into context, I'd say the invention of the
<br>
internal combustion engine is a good one,&quot; says Tim Harper, a physicist
<br>
formerly with the European Space Agency who now runs an early-stage nanotech
<br>
fund and nanotech conference group in Madrid. Talk like that would be purely
<br>
hyperbolic if not for the fact that many of the world's most prominent
<br>
scientists see this tiny art as the next big thing.  (Red Herring 12/18/02)

<p>Hot stuff. Advanced materials are moving out of the lab and into the
<br>
commercial world. Once regarded as laboratory curiosities, smart materials
<br>
are beginning to make their mark on some high-profile commercial
<br>
applications. This class of materials encompasses a broad range of ceramics,
<br>
metal alloys, gels, and polymers. What sets them apart is their ability to
<br>
adapt when they're exposed to external stimuli, such as temperature,
<br>
magnetism, or electricity. Piezoelectric crystals and magneto-rheological
<br>
fluids have been around for years. Now, newer exotic alloys and polymers
<br>
with intriguing properties are joining them. Some of the more recent
<br>
arrivals in the lab, such as carbon nanotubes, are still the subject of
<br>
basic research. Yet others have made the transition into commercial
<br>
applications.

<p>The Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy. From the Lab to the
<br>
Battlefield? Nanotechnology and Fourth-Generation Nuclear Weapons. By André
<br>
Gsponer. In Disarmament Diplomacy No. 65, Sean Howard warned of the dangers
<br>
of enhanced or even new types of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) emerging
<br>
from the development of 'nanotechnology', an umbrella term for a range of
<br>
potentially revolutionary engineering techniques at the atomic and molecular
<br>
level.1 Howard called for urgent preliminary consideration to be given to
<br>
the benefits and practicalities of negotiating an 'Inner Space Treaty' to
<br>
guard against such developments. While echoing this call, this paper draws
<br>
attention to the existing potential of nanotechnology to affect dangerous
<br>
and destabilizing 'refinements' to existing nuclear weapon designs.
<br>
Historically, nanotechnology is a child of the nuclear weapons labs, a
<br>
creation of the WMD-industrial complex. The most far-reaching and fateful
<br>
impacts of nanotechnology, therefore, may lie - and can already be seen - in
<br>
the same area.

<p>Human Cloning is the Least Interesting Application of Cloning Technology. By

Ray Kurzweil. Cloning is an extremely important technology--not for cloning

humans but for life extension: therapeutic cloning of one's own organs,

creating new tissues to replace defective tissues or organs, or replacing
<br>
one's organs and tissues with their &quot;young&quot; telomere-extended replacements

without surgery. Cloning even offers a possible solution for world hunger:

creating meat without animals. (Kurzweilai.net January 03)
