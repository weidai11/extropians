Betterhumans - Longer Life Won't Bankrupt Health Systems, Study Suggests
<br>
=============================================================================

<br>
<p>While critics worry that longer-living baby boomers will overburden
<br>
health systems with their need for expensive medical treatments, a new
<br>
study suggests that such fears are overblown. By living longer and
<br>
healthier, baby boomers will not need the most heroic and therefore
<br>
expensive medical treatments, says a study published in the January
<br>
issue of the Journal of Gerontology.

Sirtuin protein has a new function; May play role in lifespan extension

<br>
<p>Scientists from Johns Hopkins and the University of Wisconsin have
<br>
discovered that a protein called Sir2, which is found in nearly all
<br>
living cells, has a new function that might help explain how calorie
<br>
restriction can increase lifespans for some animals, the scientists say.
<br>
Their report appeared in the Dec. 20 issue of Science.

<p>Following more announcements of cloned babies from Clonaid, the North
<br>
American Transhumanist community has spoken out against what it sees as
<br>
reckless and unethical behaviour on the part of the Raelian religious

sect. At the same time, Transhumanists, as staunch advocates of personal
<br>
reproductive freedoms, are voicing support for reproductive human

cloning while expressing concerns over how the media is portraying the
<br>
position of scientists, ethicists and the general public.

<p>The science circus comes to town when a group like the Raelians claims

to be cloning children, announcing one arrival just in time to fill the

holiday news vacuum. The news came as a shock but not much of a

surprise. It was only a matter of time before one of the teams racing to

<p>WHAT ARE THE PRESSING SCIENTIFIC ISSUES FOR THE NATION AND THE WORLD,
<br>
AND WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE ON HOW I CAN BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THEM? I (John
<br>
Brockman) have asked Edge contributors for &quot;hard-edge&quot; questions,
<br>
derived from empirical results or experience specific to their
<br>
expertise, that render visible the deeper meanings of our lives,
<br>
redefine who and what we are. The goal is a series of interrogatives in

<p>A World Question Center review: at the end of every year, John Brockman,

a literary agent and the publisher of Edge.org, a Web site devoted to
<br>
science, poses a question to leading scientists, writers and futurists.

In 2002, he asked respondents to imagine that they had been nominated as

White House science adviser and that President Bush had sought their

answer to &quot;What are the pressing scientific issues for the nation and
<br>
the world, and what is your advice on how I can begin to deal with

them?&quot; Here are excerpts of some of the responses...

Life Extension Foundation - Protein blocks chromosome breaks at fragile

=============================================================================

<a href="http://www.lef.org/news/disease/2003/01/02/eng-newsrx/eng-newsrx_084029_8041128341890109505.ew.html">http://www.lef.org/news/disease/2003/01/02/eng-newsrx/eng-newsrx_084029_8041128341890109505.ew.html</a>
<br>
<p>With 46 chromosomes and 6 feet of DNA to copy every time most human
<br>
cells divide, it's not surprising that gaps or breaks sometimes show up
<br>
in the finished product - especially when the cell is under stress or
<br>
dividing rapidly, as in cancer. But what is surprising - according to
<br>
Thomas Glover, PhD, a geneticist at the University of Michigan Medical
<br>
School - is that the breaks don't always occur at random. They happen at
<br>
a few specific locations on chromosomes, when cells are under stress,
<br>
during the stages in the cell cycle where DNA is copied and the cell
<br>
splits into two identical daughter cells.

<p>The strength of the Honey Bee Genome Project proposal to the NIH lay in

several factors, Weaver said. It pointed out the honey bee: Has a

<br>
<p>Kurzweil enters the current debate on human cloning: Cloning is an
<br>
extremely important technology - not for cloning humans but for life
<br>
extension: therapeutic cloning of one's own organs, creating new tissues
<br>
to replace defective tissues or organs, or replacing one's organs and
<br>
tissues with their &quot;young&quot; telomere-extended replacements without
<br>
surgery. Cloning even offers a possible solution for world hunger:

creating meat without animals...

<p>The failure of Europe's new super rocket, the Ariane 5-ESCA, on its
<br>
maiden flight last month was caused by a fault in its main rocket motor,
<br>
a commission of inquiry said on Tuesday. The investigators said a

leakage in the cooling system affected the thrust on the main Vulcain-2

engine, causing the vehicle to spin out of control.

reports said the next launch

<br>
least one Chinese astronaut. If China successfully completes a manned

<p>China's fourth rehearsal for a manned space mission ended Sunday when an

bringing the country one step closer to putting a person in space.

or &quot;divine ship,&quot; would probably be the last test before China attempts

to become the third nation to achieve manned spaceflight.
