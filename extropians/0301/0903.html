<p>Nanotech oversight bill reintroduced. Legislation establishing a government
<br>
advisory board to oversee a U.S. nanotechnology initiative was reintroduced
<br>
this week in the House of Representatives. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Mike
<br>
Honda, D-Calif., calls for industry and university experts to serve on an
<br>
advisory panel that would advise the Bush administration and Congress on
<br>
research investments and goals for the U.S. National Nanotechnology
<br>
Initiative. Similar legislation was introduced in October by Honda, a member
<br>
of the House Science Committee. The bill calls for the formation of an
<br>
advisory panel that would develop short-, medium- and long-range objectives
<br>
for nanotechnology development over the next decade and beyond. (EE Times

<p>UMass team develops novel self-assembly processes for nanotech applications.
<br>
Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have developed a
<br>
series of novel techniques in nanotechnology that hold promise for
<br>
applications ranging from highly targeted pharmaceutical therapies, to
<br>
development of nutrition-enhanced foods known as &quot;nutraceuticals,&quot; to
<br>
nanoscopic sensors that might one day advance medical imaging and

diagnostics. The research, published in the Jan. 10 issue of Science, was
<br>
funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.

<p>(Space) Researchers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope reported today they

are seeing the conclusion of the cosmic epoch called the &quot;Dark Ages,&quot; a time
<br>
about a billion years after the big bang when newly-formed stars and
<br>
galaxies were just starting to become visible. &quot;With the Hubble Telescope,
<br>
we can now see back to the epoch when stars in young galaxies began to shine

in significant numbers, concluding the cosmic 'dark ages' about 13 billion
<br>
years ago,&quot; said Haojing Yan, a Ph.D. graduate student at Arizona State

<p>UT consortium formed for nanotechnology research. The provosts of five
<br>
University of Texas campuses signed a memorandum of understanding Thursday
<br>
intended to position their schools in the forefront of nanotechnology
<br>
research. Nanotechnology involves working at atomic, molecular and
<br>
supramolecular levels to create materials with entirely new physical or
<br>
chemical properties by virtue of their sizes, which are smaller than the
<br>
wavelength of light.
<br>
The most fascinating aspect of nanotechnology is that the properties of
<br>
familiar substances change at very small sizes, said Paul Barbara, the
<br>
director of the Center for Nano- and Molecular Science and Technology at
<br>
UT-Austin.

<p>The possibility for the production of new types of weapons of mass
<br>
destruction (WMD) is emerging as the burgeoning field of nanotechnology
<br>
(NT) - the science of designing microscopic structures in which materials
<br>
are machined and manipulated atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule - matures.
<br>
While specialists agree that its widespread use by the military is some ways
<br>
off, it is likely that it will be increasingly employed, especially as this
<br>
new science develops. Under such monikers as &quot;micromechanical engineering&quot;
<br>
and &quot;microelectromechanical systems&quot; (MEMS), the field of NT was born 30
<br>
years ago in nuclear weapons laboratories. Its present application has been
<br>
to refine existing nuclear weapon designs. But its greatest potential,
<br>
however, remains on the drawing board. Nanotechnology has the potential to
<br>
create entirely new weapons. Fourth-generation nuclear weapons are new types
<br>
of nuclear explosives that would use inertial confinement fusion (ICF)
<br>
facilities.

University scientists are teaming up with NASA on a nanotechnology institute

Nanoelectronics and Computing is to design miniature supercomputers that can

make unmanned probes autonomous enough to react quickly when unexpected

problems arise far from Earth. But the same technology would also lead to

tiny, lightweight and energy-efficient sensors, and communication,

navigation and propulsion systems for spacecraft, said Supriyo Datta, the

new institute's director. (Indystar 1/15/03)

<p>Add Ceramic Fracture Protection to the List of Nanotube Attributes. Ceramics
<br>
are famous for being hard, but easy to break. Now, researchers have

demonstrated that adding carbon nanotubes to a ceramic material can nearly

triple its resistance to fracturing. Since carbon nanotubes were discovered
<br>
a decade ago, ceramics researchers have tried to exploit the tiny tubes'
<br>
extraordinary strength and flexibility to make much more fracture-resistant

materials. Such durable materials could eventually replace conventional

ceramics or even metals in countless products, says Joshua D. Kuntz of the

manipulated an organism successfully to make it produce an unnatural amino

Manufacturing this unnatural bacterium could lead to the manipulation of

others to manufacture antibiotics, enzymes or other compounds for human use,

Mehl said. By adding a novel amino acid, another protein building block, the

bacterium could produce proteins not found in nature and with unknown

potential, he said. (United Press International 1/13/03)
