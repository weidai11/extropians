</em><br>
<p>Your thesis has a few problems.
<br>
<p>1) Why have none of the myriad groups that are studying and

attempting to cure AIDS agreeing with your argument?
<br>
<p>2) How do you suppose non-drug using, non-hemophiliac, heterosexual 
<br>
men and women manage to pass this disease to one another.  It is an 
<br>
established fact that they do so.  Do they somehow infect each other 
<br>
with stress which gives results that somehow look like a deadly case 
<br>
of AIDS?   Somehow I think not.
<br>
<p>3) Why are HIV positive test results also just as correlated with 
<br>
development of AIDS in non-risk groups?
<br>
<p>4) I would advise strongly against having unprotected sex on the wild 
<br>
theory that AIDS is not infectious!  I know people who today have 
<br>
AIDS (replete with full symptoms, not just testing positive) who 
<br>
believed such arguments.  I beg of everyone here not to believe the 
<br>
argument to the extent of acting fully consistently with it.

<p><p><em>&gt; Fumento's predictions on AIDS epidemiology in America and western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europe have proven to be much more accurate than the past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicitons of our gov health authorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would go further and argue that AIDS science is fundamentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flawed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the 1960's a central dogma of molecular genetics was that DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaves in a static way; DNA makes RNA; RNA cannot be transcribed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back into DNA; RNA comes into existence only on the basis of DNA.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1970, when they detected biochemically that there is a reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow of genetic material, they didn't give up the dogma or even try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to change it. Instead, they called it an exception to a central
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogma of molecular genetics, and explained it by postulating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of retroviruses. It was believed that the presence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reverse Transcriptise activity was unambiguous evidence of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of a novel virus, a retrovirus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When Montagnier and Gallo first tried to isolate a virus from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blood of sick patients they saw RT activity and took that as strong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence of the presence of a retrovirus. However, reverse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transcription activity is not unique to retroviruses, and in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is now appreciated that RT activity in normal cells is promoted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the very conditions which Montagnier and Gallo subjected their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patients' T-cells to. Therefore, detection of RT activity in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures was not proof that there was a retrovirus present.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In 1997 the leading science journal Virology published two papers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that provided stunning new data on the &quot;isolation&quot; of HIV.(1)(2) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the first time, electron microscope images of &quot;HIV&quot; banded at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the density required for retroviruses were published. They revealed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;major contaminants&quot; in &quot;pure HIV&quot;, consisting of an excess of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vesicles - particles of cellular proteins.(3)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When Montagnier was asked in July 1997 by French Journalist Djamel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tahi why such photos were not previously published, his answer was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because, even after &quot;Roman effort&quot;, they could see no particles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with &quot;morphology typical of retroviruses. I repeat we did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purify...&quot;(4)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The samples Montagnier and Gallo called &quot;viral isolates&quot; contain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few objects that resemble retroviruses (the &quot;HIV&quot;) plus lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other things, which clearly aren't viruses. Without a pure isolate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of virus-like particles,  there is no way to extract proteins and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetic material out of a molecular soup and know that they came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from one group of particular looking objects rather than another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As the Perth Group [<a href="http://www.theperthgroup.com/menu.htm">http://www.theperthgroup.com/menu.htm</a>] argues,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Unlike other viruses [HIV] has never been isolated as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independent stable particle.&quot;(5)  Considering the 1997 Virology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; release of the photos showing no viral isolation, and Montagnier's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admission that &quot;.we did not purify&quot;; it is hard to deny the logic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The inability to isolate the virus means no proteins which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viral and free from contaminants have ever been obtained, thus no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can be certain what the antibodies are that bind to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins. This is the heart of the problem facing all HIV tests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The manufacturer of the most popular HIV test kit openly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledges, &quot;there is no recognized standard for establishing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence or absence of antibodies to HIV in human blood.&quot;(6)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if a positive &quot;HIV&quot; test does not detect antibodies to a virus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why then is it correlated with a higher incidence of developing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIDS diseases, at least in high-risk groups?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eleopulos et al [the Perth Group] had noticed a link between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIDS risk groups in the US and Europe. Gay men, drug users and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haemophiliacs are exposed to foreign semen, nitrites, illicit drugs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and factor VIII (the blood clotting protein that haemophiliacs must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inject). These substances are potent cellular oxidants.(7) When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oxidation is prolonged or excessive, cells become abnormal, injured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and susceptible to diseases.  In Eleopulos' view, oxidative stress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces biochemical signals that have been misinterpreted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence of a new virus. The immune system produces antibodies in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to stress, but these antibodies are to products of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disordered cells, not to an invading virus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Normal human DNA contains retroviral information which did not get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there following a retroviral infection. The cell was born with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.(8)  So amongst all our DNA there are stretches made up of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; retroviral information and that may sit there maybe all your life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until something happens. The DNA starts to make RNA and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins, and this may go even further and lead to the assembly of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endogenous retroviral particles. They're called endogenous because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're not something that got in from the outside. Like HIV is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to. Something that gets in from the outside is called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exogenous. Long before the AIDS era everyone knew that in animal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells endogenous retrovirus production could occur spontaneously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You make a cell culture and do nothing else. Just leave it on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bench for a few days or maybe a few weeks and then one day it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starts to produce retroviral-like particles. They seemingly come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of nowhere and the process can be significantly accelerated and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the yield of particles increased, sometimes millions of times, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions which induce cellular activation, the same conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are obligatory to obtain what is called HIV from cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, false positives may be caused by vaccinations against other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diseases or current or past diseases.(9)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Perth Groups non-infectious AIDS model would explain why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fumento's predictions were more accurate than those by mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health authorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would also predict that we all can produce proteins and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibodies that would trigger a positive &quot;AIDS&quot; result if we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to certain stressful conditions [see note 9 for references
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to 64 conditions that can cause false-positive HIV test results].
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dr. Robert Giraldo has worked from 1993 to present as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologist in the Laboratories of Clinical Immunology and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Molecular diagnosis at the New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cornell Medical Center, in New York City. He had the opportunity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run and know in detail the Elisa, Western blot and PCR (viral load)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tests for HIV. The ELISA test is a test for antibodies against what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is supposed to be the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV. To run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this test, an individual's serum has to be diluted to a ratio of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1:400 with a special specimen diluent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This extraordinarily high dilution of the person's serum [400
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times] took him by surprise. Most serologic tests that look for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence of antibodies against germs uses neat serum [undiluted].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, the tests that look for antibodies to hepatitis A and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B viruses, rubella virus, syphilis, hystoplasma and cryptococus, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention a few of them, use undiluted serum. However, to try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent false positive reactions some serologic tests use diluted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serum; for example this is the case with tests that look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibodies to measles, varicella and mumps viruses which use a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilution of 1:16, to cytomegalovirus [CMV] 1:20 and to Epstein-Barr
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Virus [EBV] 1:10.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The obvious questions are: What makes HIV so unique that the test
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serum needs to be diluted 400 times? And what would happen if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual's serum is not diluted ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quoting Dr. Giraldo (10):
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To answer these questions I ran an experiment in a medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laboratory in Yorktown Heights, New York. I ran it using the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; test kit reagents that are usually used to run the ELISA test in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most clinical laboratories worldwide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I first took samples of blood that, at 1:400 dilution, tested
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative for antibodies to HIV. I then ran the exact same serum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samples through the test again, but this time without diluting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. Tested straight, they all came positive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since that time I have run about 100 specimens and have always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gotten the same result. I even ran my own blood which at 1:400
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reacts negative. At 1:1 [undiluted] it reacted positive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The following are three possible explanations for why undiluted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specimens of blood always react positive at the ELISA test:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Everybody has HIV antibodies...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Everybody has different levels of HIV infection...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3. The test is not specific for HIV...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only proper way for establishing the sensitivity and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specificity of a given test is with a gold standard. However, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HIV has never been isolated as an independent purified viral entity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (11-13), there cannot be a gold standard for HIV.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since there is no scientific evidence that the ELISA test is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specific for HIV antibodies, a reactive ELISA test at any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentration of the serum would mean presence of non-specific or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polyspecific antibodies (14). These antibodies could be present in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all blood samples. They are most likely a result of the stress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response, having no relation to any retrovirus, let alone HIV
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (15,16). In this case, a reactive test could be a measure of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of one's exposure to stressor or oxidizing agents (17,18).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [end Giraldo quote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To choose between competing theories, it is often productive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compare predictions. In this regard, I think the non-infectious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AIDS theory of the Perth Group has fared better than the mainstream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infectious AIDS theory. Your mileage may vary.
