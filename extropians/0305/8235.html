<p>Since there were several extropians that attended
<br>
the Foresight gathering and the gathering after
<br>
that, I will take the liberty to cross-post these
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p>Several questions came up at the post nanoschmooze
<br>
gathering gathering.  At this gathering^2, we had a
<br>
number of people who could name all six flavors of
<br>
quarks, could write out Bayes law, could program in
<br>
everything from Fortran to Java, and yet there are
<br>
some basic questions that eluded us all.  Many of these
<br>
were on the same lines as the post extro-5 gathering,
<br>
when we pondered such things as:  if one were in a
<br>
tank filled with xenon at 215 atmospheres, would one
<br>
float?  What if one injects a sedative into one
<br>
carotid artery, and one hemisphere of ones brain
<br>
is asleep, and one had half an erotic dream, what
<br>
would happen?
<br>
<p>This is a partial list of this year's imponderables,
<br>
plus a few that I simply made up, or that someone
<br>
would have asked, had we been inhabiting one of
<br>
the other many worlds:
<br>
<p>If the market and google form two members of the
<br>
holy trinity, what is the third?
<br>
<p>Why is it that about half the spam today is some prole
<br>
who stole a bunch of money in Nigeria and they want
<br>
to give it to me?  Has anyone ever actually fallen for
<br>
that silly gag?  Since the Nigerian got my name as someone
<br>
who is trustworthy, who is it that gave it to them?
<br>
I want to know who considers *me* trustworthy.
<br>
<p>What is the opposite of surreal?  Is it surphony?
<br>
Perhaps surfake?  Surimaginary?  Or just plain real?
<br>
Surreal is kind of unreal, in a way, so the prefix
<br>
sur must mean negative or not or un.  So when someone
<br>
makes a joke that offends or falls flat, could we
<br>
say that person is surfunny?
<br>
<p>How did Palm Pilots get their name?  What has a
<br>
hand held computing device to do with guiding an
<br>
aircraft or ship?
<br>
<p>The old movie The Birds caused us no end to
<br>
curiosity.  Many of us have not seen the movie
<br>
for many years, so our memories are dim, but perhaps
<br>
someone here can enlighten us.  Clearly Hitchcock
<br>
demonstrated sheer genius in making something truly
<br>
frightening out of something as sur-scary as a flock
<br>
of birds with their beaks out of joint.  But what
<br>
exactly was making these birds so crazy?  Perhaps
<br>
they explained it in the movie and we just forgot.
<br>
What made them chill out in that last scene when
<br>
the three (?) people get in a car and drive away?
<br>
In that scene where they find the guy dead in the
<br>
house, what exactly was the actual cause of death?
<br>
Did a bunch of birds actually peck him to death?  In
<br>
that scene I do not recall seeing any bird corpses
<br>
in the room.  Was it not a quite poor showing, downright
<br>
embarrassing, on the part of the hominid, considering
<br>
he outweighed each of his opponents by a factor of at
<br>
least 20 to 1, not to mention the opposable thumbs?
<br>
Is there anyone here who does not think they could take
<br>
on a flock of birds in hand to feather combat, assuming
<br>
the battle takes place indoors?  (Come on Beak-boy, you
<br>
wanna piece of me?)  Could not one surely slay at least
<br>
a few?  Why was no one in that town armed?  (Hey, Mr.
<br>
Feathers, meet Mr. Twelve Gage.)  Could not the NRA use
<br>
that as a good reason for every man, woman and child to
<br>
pack heat, as a precaution against crazed flocks of birds?
<br>
One can never be too careful you know.
<br>
<p>Why is it that when extropian/SL4/singularitarian/
<br>
transhumanist types gather, people bring *SO MUCH BEER*
<br>
and then devour so very little of it?
<br>
<p>What the helllll did people do before there were
<br>
computers?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
<br>
<p>What did we do before there was an internet?
<br>
<p>What did extropians do before there was google?  Did
<br>
we just go around, like, not knowing stuff?
<br>
<p>When we get wearable internet connections with
<br>
voice interface and fast google connections 24-7,
<br>
how are we going to explain to young people how we
<br>
ever got along without that?
<br>
<p>Do they have crossword puzzles in French?  Do they
<br>
have a bunch of American words in them?  Still?
<br>
<p>Why is it, exactly, that sushi is soooo good?  Its
<br>
nothing but a wad of rice and a slice of bait, yet we
<br>
cheerfully drive way across town to get some.  Why?
<br>
<p>How many jokes are there that start with some
<br>
variation of: An engineer, a mathematician and
<br>
a physicist go to a {fill in the blank}...  We
<br>
heard about 800 hundred of them, and we weren't
<br>
even slowing down when the party spontaneously
<br>
gave out.  Why is it that the mathematician always
<br>
says something silly and disconnected from reality
<br>
as we know it?  Are there any of those jokes where
<br>
the mathematician is the smart guy?  I like
<br>
mathematicians.
<br>
<p>Was I imagining it, or was there a spontaneous
<br>
outbreak of niceness on the extropians list?  I thought
<br>
I detected it three weeks ago last Tuesday, for several
<br>
hours.
<br>
<p>Are there any foods that Homer Simpson does not like?
<br>
What would he say as a prefix to that food?  Sur-mmmm?
<br>
<p>What happens if an autistic prisoner is sentenced to
<br>
solitary confinement?  Would she know?
<br>
<p>How much power could be saved if the light inside
<br>
the refrigerator were not left on all the time?
<br>
<p>Why is it that there are so many extropians with
<br>
such enormous IQ numbers who cannot deal with
<br>
any mechanical device more complicated than a
<br>
cerial box?
<br>
<p>Was Monte Hall intentionally screwing with people's
<br>
minds all those years?
<br>
<p>If Ameridebt got some loser's monthly payment cut
<br>
in half, why didn't he just call them again and get
<br>
it cut in forth, then an eighth and so on until he
<br>
was debt free?
<br>
<p>Does *anyone* who hangs out on extropians or SL4
<br>
ever read actual *fiction*, without the prefix
<br>
science?  Sears and Roebuck catalogs?
<br>
<p>How did future fiction ever get the prefix sci to
<br>
start with?  Havent we always had science?  Did the
<br>
inventors of the genre assume we would have more
<br>
science in the future?
<br>
<p>What do we call those oddball subcategories of
<br>
speculative sci-fi like that show from the 60s
<br>
called Wild Wild West, where they had some weird
<br>
futuristic technologies but was actually set in
<br>
the past?  Is it still science fiction?  For that
<br>
matter, Star Wars is another good example.
<br>
<p>How did the diet thread get so huge?
<br>
<p>If we somehow accidentally discovered a seventh
<br>
quark flavor, wont the physicists be majorly screwed
<br>
up?  Would they attempt a cover-up?  Would we call
<br>
it still-more-strange?
<br>
<p><p>Cannot book publishers invent a kind of paper that
<br>
does not get that old book smell when one's text
<br>
books get old?  Would not it be a terrific business
<br>
opportunity, to make replicas of old college textbooks
<br>
with new paper, so that one is not constantly reminded
<br>
that one is way into one's geezerhood?
<br>
<p>If Marilyn vos Savant were to get on drugs and lose
<br>
her mental focus, would we have to rename her Marilyn
<br>
vos Stupid?  Or would she become merely vos Normal?
<br>
SurSavant?  Would anyone have guessed that a person
<br>
could make a career out of simply understanding the
<br>
Bayesian Theorem?
<br>
<p>Assuming the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum
<br>
mechanics, how can we be *absolutely sure* that this
<br>
is one of them?
<br>
<p>This is all the unanswered questions I can recall from
<br>
that gathering^2.  If anyone who was there can recall
<br>
others, do post them.  If you have the actual answers
<br>
to any of these, or even funny suranswers, do post.
