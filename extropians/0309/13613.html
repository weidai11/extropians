Moore alters &quot;Bowling&quot; DVD in response to criticism (9/2)
<br>
<p>By &lt; mailto:<a href="mailto:brendan@spinsanity.org?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(SK)%20Re:%20Moore%20alters%20&quot;Bowling&quot;%20DVD%20in%20response%20to%20criticism">brendan@spinsanity.org</a> &gt; Brendan Nyhan
<br>
<p>In the newly-released DVD version of his Academy Award-winning documentary 
<br>
&quot;Bowling for Columbine,&quot; filmmaker Michael Moore has altered a caption that 
<br>
he fictitiously inserted into a 1988 Bush-Quayle campaign commercial -- one 
<br>
of a number of misstatements and deceptive arguments 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20021119.html">http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20021119.html</a>&gt;we criticized when the 
<br>
film was released last year. Ironically, on the same day the DVD was 
<br>
released, Moore &lt;<a href="http://stacks.msnbc.com:80/news/955443.asp">http://stacks.msnbc.com:80/news/955443.asp</a>&gt;issued a libel 
<br>
threat against his critics on MSNBC's &quot;Buchanan &amp; Press,&quot; saying, &quot;Every 
<br>
fact in the film is true. Absolutely every fact in the film is true. And 
<br>
anybody who says otherwise is committing an act of libel.&quot;
<br>
<p>While we were among the first to call Moore on the inaccuracies in his 
<br>
film, most notably the alteration of the Bush-Quayle ad and his misleading 
<br>
presentation of US aid to Afghanistan in a timeline sequence, we were far 
<br>
from the only ones. Dan Lyons of Forbes Magazine

<br>
revealed several important lies or distortions, including the fact that the 
<br>
scene during which Moore receives a gun at a bank was staged. And David 
<br>
Hardy, an Arizona lawyer specializing in gun issues who has worked for the 
<br>
National Rifle Association, has 
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html">http://www.hardylaw.net/Truth_About_Bowling.html</a>&gt;compiled a voluminous 
<br>
list of allegations, including Moore's 
<br>

<p>I saw &quot;Bowling&quot; after reading some of the criticism especially the
<br>
Spinsanity articles. The movie is flawed and Moore does take some
<br>
extreme liberties with the truth which I admit he should be called to
<br>
account for. 
<br>
<p>But as confused as the movie can be regarding some of the issues, Moore
<br>
asks some damn good questions and even with faults is far better than a
<br>
thousand Ann Coulters.

<p>Unfortunately, Moore sets his own cause back by using questionable
<br>
&nbsp;tactics and manipulating the information.  The points he makes may
<br>
&nbsp;be valuable, but by re-arranging events and adding content that
<br>
&nbsp;was not in the original material he criticizes, he makes it very
<br>
&nbsp;easy for those he opposes to dismiss him.  It also makes those on
<br>
&nbsp;the fence (the most important part of the audience, in my opinion)
<br>
&nbsp;doubt the veracity of everything in his movies, no matter how true.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The best tactic, I think, is to be scrupulous about the facts,
<br>
&nbsp;so that your points are unassailable.  To do otherwise is to
<br>
&nbsp;invite failure.

White Men&quot; is repeating the &quot;Bush let bin Laden's family fly out of  the US
right after Sept 11&quot; story -- and just yesterday, the  Edinburgh Evening
News has quoted former White House counter-terrorism tzar Richard Clarke as
saying that Bush did indeed  authorize the flight of about 140 Saudis,
including bin Laden family
members, from the US.&gt;&gt;
But the issue Moore was raising wasn't simply that the government allowed
bin Laden family members to leave the USA (that fact was never shocking
news, as it was reported in major newspapers within days of its occurrence),
but specifically that they left the country &quot;two days&quot; after the attacks on
a &quot;secret flight&quot; while all other air traffic was grounded, that they had
valuable information to impart about bin Laden's whereabouts, and that they
were shuttled out of the country over the objections of the FBI, who had no
chance to question them before they were whisked away.  None of those
specifics was true: they didn't leave the country until after normal air
travel resumed (although some of them were rounded up and ferried to central
departure points by airplane while the ban on general air travel was still
in effect), they were mostly college students who had never had any contact
whatsoever with Osama bin Laden (the bin Laden family is *huge*, and most of
them were distant relatives who were mere toddlers when Osama left Saudi
Arabia for good and was disowned by his family and the Saudi government),
and their departure was organized and supervised by the FBI.

I don't know, seems to have worked for the current administration....and
Anne Coulter and Fox News and etc.
Speaking of which, just finished Al Franken's latest book - largely
about exposing the lies of those above.  Seemed like a reasonable book
to me, but who knows, maybe he distorted the facts just as bad as the
others did.
About Moore, the main point of the movie - asserting that gun violence
in the US is much much worse than gun violence in Canada - seems to be
beyond question.  You can question why it might be so and disagree with
his conclusions, but I haven't heard anyone question his primary
assertion.

In a recent interview on (the U.S.) 60 Minutes, Moore pointed out that
he shows people for what they are.  For example, Moore didn't arrange
for Charlton Heston to blame violence in the U.S. on being a mixed race
nation.  That's something that Charlton did on his own.
On the other hand, I have not seen Bowling yet.  Nor have I followed the
criticism trail closely.  So, I'm not making a definitive statement
here, just adding a point.
Then again, one of the things that impressed me about Roger &amp; Me was how
literal it was.  I don't recall Moore elucidating beyond what was shown
on screen, and every point he made was backed up with documentary
evidence.  As I recall.

Yes, but It's a bit like saying that, by and large, the US is south of 
Canada.  It's not as though his &quot;primary assertion&quot;  is a matter that 
requires much intellect to work out  and it is hardly an act of great 
courage to state the bleeding obvious.  Like Moore's idiotic statement 
that set this thread off, &quot;All the facts are true&quot;.  Well duh! Thank 
you Professor Einstein.
The point about demagogues like Moore (or David Irving as another 
example) is that they get on to an issue that a lot of people would 
LIKE to believe, sprinkle a few facts around, invent a few more, add 
non sequiturs to taste and then massage the mix until it shows whatever 
conclusion they want.   Bingo!  They now have lots of acolytes who 
think they are the bee's knees.  Next, arrange for someone to attack 
them so they can don the mantle of persecuted genius. It helps sell 
books and it must do the ego no end of good, but it doesn't advance the 
sum of human knowledge by much.

You're making Moore's point for him.  Of course anybody can look at the
statistics and see that there's a huge disparity in gun violence between
Canada and America...and yet no one talks about it, let alone have a
cogent idea of why the disparity exists.  His movie (have you seen it?)
poses the question of &quot;why?&quot; and then looks at different elements of the
two cultures.  Maybe some people don't like his &quot;conclusions&quot; but I
didn't see much in the way of conclusions myself.
