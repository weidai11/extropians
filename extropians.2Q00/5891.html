<P>
(Some snippage accidentally not marked by &quot;[....]&quot;.)
<BR>
<P><P>Max,
<BR>
<P>I continue to find myself surprised by your reaction, including
<BR>
your (seemingly willful) misreadings of my arguments, to the
<BR>
point where I think we're coming from such different
<BR>
intellectual/political/moral universes that discussing this in
<BR>
depth further won't be worth it (for me, certainly). I feel I do
<BR>
owe you 1) a justification for the preceding; and 2) a
<BR>
restatement of my original claim.
<BR>
<P>#2 first:
<BR>
<P>What happened was: someone made a comment about Extropians that
<BR>
CLEARLY was not a universal claim (how could ALL however many
<BR>
hundred list members be &quot;strident libertarians&quot;?), and I added
<BR>
other attributes, including anti-Semitism. Yes, the claims
<BR>
(Joseph's and mine) about Extropians are claims that these
<BR>
attributes are found more among Extropians than others
<BR>
(otherwise the claims would have no content), but no, they are
<BR>
not suggested to be universal -- well, I can't speak for Joseph,
<BR>
but I certainly did not, and do not, mean to make a universal
<BR>
claim about Extropians.
<BR>
<P>Indeed, I have learned a great deal from Extropians (and been
<BR>
greatly entertained!). Further, I have met people as a result of
<BR>
my participation in the Extropians list who have become friends,
<BR>
in a few cases, very dear friends.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, I stand by my earlier statements. Max, I
<BR>
completely understand why you might 1) find compressed versions
<BR>
of these arguments absurd (they make little sense absent a long
<BR>
historical argument -- see suggested reading), and, either way
<BR>
2) have a strong enough desire to defend your Institute (the
<BR>
reputation of which can even have a bearing on your livelihood,
<BR>
given your new consulting business) that you might not be
<BR>
entirely open-minded here. (And I also belief that, up to a
<BR>
point, an open mind is an empty mind: one has to take a stand
<BR>
somewhere, and terra firma must be terra incognita!)
<BR>
<P><P>As for #1, I'll just make points along the way here (also
<BR>
responding briefly to the relatively less controversial question
<BR>
of libertarianism and Extropianism).

<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Brian, it's obvious that you have some serious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political disagreements with not only Extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but perhaps most other transhumanists. Since you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't distinctly lay out your views, I'm not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure how much and where you disagree, but I get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the impression that you favor a strong state
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would regulate transhumanizing technologies.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure. I doubt we'll need a government stronger than that
<BR>
we have now in the U.S. (but this would depend on circumstance).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Rather than speculating further, I'll stick to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; responding to your comments.

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I let the first comment (the first paragraph above go by),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; but this is too much. First, yes many extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; call themselves libertarian or are very sympathetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; to libertarian approaches. This is true of very many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; transhumanists, Extropians or not.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Yes.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Okay, you agree. So why did you originally point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at finger at Extropians, rather than at us and all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other transhumanists whose political views
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; differ from yours? If you don't want me to think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you're attacking Extropians, then perhaps it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would help for you to include in your critique
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all other relevant transhumanists.
</EM><BR>
<P>Point of logic:
<BR>
<P>There's a difference between:
<BR>
1. &quot;Extropians tend to be X,&quot; and 
<BR>
2. &quot;Extropians are the only ones who tend to be X.&quot;
<BR>
<P>(Recall the original post to which I was responding.)
<BR>
<P>Sure, there are people who aren't Extropians who have the
<BR>
characteristics in question. But Extropians have them to a
<BR>
greater degree. So the question that interests me is the
<BR>
possibility of a systematic connection between Extropianism and
<BR>
these characteristics. (And it is indeed a question, not a
<BR>
thesis cast in stone.) Thus, whether or not members of other
<BR>
lists also have these characteristics is not relevant (given
<BR>
that they don't have them to the same degree).
<BR>
<P>&quot;Native Americans drink a lot.&quot; -&quot;But Irish-Americans drink a
<BR>
lot too! Why didn't you mention them?&quot; If one wants to
<BR>
understand Native American drinking, Irish-American drinking
<BR>
isn't necessarily relevant (except as a comparison:
<BR>
Irish-Americans drink a lot, but LESS than Native Americans. Why
<BR>
is that?)
<BR>
<P>Sorry if the ex. is patronizing. Just want to be crystal clear.
<BR>
I'm not interested in placing Evil labels on people. I'm
<BR>
interested in understanding.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But please not that, if you read the Extropian Principles,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; libertarianism is not mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;True, but not relevant.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You've lost me. How can this not be relevant?
</EM><BR>
<P>Because one can be a libertarian without having a bumper sticker
<BR>
(or princilple) saying &quot;I'm a libertarian&quot;; ergo, the absence of
<BR>
any explicit claims about libertarianism in the Principles means
<BR>
very little, if anything. (See the bit about political
<BR>
expediency below.)
<BR>
<P><P>[....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Extropians need not be libertarians.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; This seems difficult to believe (In truth, Max,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I'm surprised at your efforts [here, and in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; past] to distance Extropianism from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; libertarianism. There can be a right-wing trans-humanism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; and a left-wing. Extropianism can be the right-wing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; version. Why should that be a problem for you?) 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Two things here: First, your use of &quot;right-wing&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and &quot;left-wing&quot; is just going to add to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confusion. That one-dimensional categorization
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of political views is almost worthless even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without getting into any transhumanist ideas. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree. Left vs. right is an extremely useful
<BR>
categorization. Of course it doesn't capture all aspects of
<BR>
political views, but how could it? It does, however, capture one
<BR>
important thing: differences in the relation of the individual
<BR>
to the state. I think of it this way. When George Bush (daddy
<BR>
Bush) warned in the 1988 pres. debates (or 92?) that people
<BR>
might have to &quot;hold on to their wallets,&quot; the VAST majority
<BR>
people watching reacted in one of two ways:
<BR>
<P>1) They agreed, or could relate, because:
<BR>
a) they strongly believe the wallet is theirs, and theirs alone,
<BR>
and
<BR>
b) they strongly think the group &quot;taking&quot; from their wallet is
<BR>
&quot;NOT-ME.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Or:
<BR>
2) They disagreed, or could not relate, because:
<BR>
a) they don't quite so strongly believe the money in the wallet
<BR>
is theirs, and theirs alone -- though, more often, and much more
<BR>
importantly:
<BR>
b) they don't so strongly think the group &quot;taking&quot; from their
<BR>
wallet is &quot;NOT-ME&quot;: government is by and of the people.
<BR>
<P>#1 is right-wing, #2 is left-wing.
<BR>
<P>Of COURSE there are lots of other axes along which political
<BR>
views can usefully be measured, and lots of different degrees of
<BR>
leftism and rightism. So what?
<BR>
<P>What adds to the confusion is precisely the opposite of what
<BR>
concerns you: the adding of extra dimensions to the measurement
<BR>
of the political landscape that create fine divisions that
<BR>
aren't generally relevant.
<BR>
<P>I do see, however, how it might be politically expedient to
<BR>
bring all X-humanists under one umbrella, a goal which is
<BR>
furthered by a masking of political differences in order to
<BR>
highlight commonality. But political expedience has little
<BR>
interest to me here. (NB: An interesting question is why more
<BR>
Extropians who vote for a U.S. president will [most likely -- I
<BR>
base this on public and private responses to the &quot;ZOG vs. COG&quot;
<BR>
discussion] vote for Bush than any other candidate. It's
<BR>
interesting because Bush is clearly not a very good choice for
<BR>
X-humanists. Also interesting: guess what political view will be
<BR>
overwhelmingly represented in the disagreements with my point
<BR>
about the X-humanist credentials of Bush?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Describing Extropians as &quot;right-wing&quot; is unhelpful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, per above, I disagree. For one thing, it's correct.
<BR>
Whether or not it's bad is a different question. I'm not sure.
<BR>
I've moved somewhat in a neo-conservative direction in recent
<BR>
years, so I'm less inclined to see it as bad than many might be.
<BR>
Far more importantly, to me, is that the generally right-wing
<BR>
nature of Extropians is a fascinating phenomenon, given the
<BR>
growing popularity of Extropianism. It raises interesting
<BR>
sociological and political questions.
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps that's the source of your problem--you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are taking some unsavory views labeled as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;right-wing&quot; and assuming they apply to other people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of whose views
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be called &quot;right-wing&quot; in a different sense.
</EM><BR>
<P>Absolutely wrong (as far as I can inspect my soul accurately).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; That would explain your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comments about anti-Semitism (which I find bizarre and which I'm sure will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprise my friend and long-time Extropian Simon Levy).
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, they didn't surprise my friend and long time
<BR>
anti-Extropian, Molochai Simon.
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Brian's comments are more disturbing. They seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely unfair, and misrepresent the Extropians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the Extropian list (quite apart from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; broader community of Extropians beyond the list).
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;(For the record, I just want to clarify that I was referring to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the people one encounters in the main mailing list, and not all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of them at that.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I'm glad you say &quot;seem,&quot; though am disturbed that by the end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;here you've devolved to presumptuous charges of &quot;slander.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You *did* misrepresent the people on the list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You did not qualify your statements. That would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lead most readers to assume that you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; talking about a universal or near-universal set
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of views about the issues you mentioned.
</EM><BR>
<P>I disagree, as explained above, but, given that I don't quite
<BR>
solidly feel I'm correct about the expositional question, let me
<BR>
apologize again for not making clearer that I wasn't making a
<BR>
universal or near universal statement. Such a statement would
<BR>
not represent my views (nor the truth).
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Brian, I have to say that your comments about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-Semitism seem so far off-base to me that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find it hard to respond. Your evidence for anti-Semitism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears to be (a) that some people on the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argued that circumcision is a bad idea (apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contrary to your religious or cultural views);
</EM><BR>
<P>Yikes! If you think it's contrary to my religious or culture
<BR>
views, you were reading with extraordinary sloppiness. I
<BR>
explicitly mentioned the irrational adduction of medical
<BR>
evidence.
<BR>
<P>For the record, I've been an atheist since the age of 7 (when
<BR>
Father O'Whatever couldn't explain where the women of Nod came
<BR>
from -- and, btw, where DO they come from?).
<BR>
<P>Hm.... this discussion probably isn't worth continuing much
<BR>
further.
<BR>
<P>Suggested reading:
<BR>
<P>_Judeophobia_, by Peter Schäfer
<BR>
<P>_A Legacy Of Hate: Anti-Semitism In America_, by Ernest Volknian
<BR>
<P>The second definitely borders on Jewish paranoia at points,
<BR>
which I found annoying. But the American history is quite
<BR>
useful.
<BR>
<P>Well, a bit more.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (b) that people have mentioned Ayn Rand's Jewish birth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name (!!);
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeez.... Again, sloppy reading. It's not the mentioning of Ayn
<BR>
Rand's birth name but the WAY that it's mentioned; and far more
<BR>
importantly, this was just a quick example of a general
<BR>
phenomenon. The GENERAL phenomenon is the reason, not this
<BR>
PARTICULAR example. There are tons more examples -- the
<BR>
irrational way that Israel has been singled out for criticism
<BR>
about something that other countries also have done, for one.
<BR>
<P>You don't seem &quot;to have ears&quot; for this discusion (to speak
<BR>
Nietzschean). So I think I'll stop here.
<BR>
<P>There seems to be much more general interest in the question of
<BR>
Extropian libertarianism, so perhaps that would be worth
<BR>
discussing further, if there's any desire to discuss any of this
<BR>
furhter.
<BR>
<P>Wait (again), one last thing --
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;#2 would be the strongest, except that I've only seen it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;exemplified occasionally. About #1: there's a long literature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about the anti-Semitic implications of irrational circumcision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;discussions.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And, of course, all discussions of circumcision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that reach a conclusion different from yours are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrational? (Now I think we're clear what's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on here!)
</EM><BR>
<P>Come on, Max, aren't you a philosopher? Consider the question of
<BR>
the difference between &quot;I believe X&quot; and &quot;I believe that X.&quot;
<BR>
Wait, let me put it this way. Let's say you claim I'm being
<BR>
irrational (or careless or slanderous) in my claims -- would it
<BR>
make sense, or serve any purpose, for me to say: &quot;And, of
<BR>
course, all discussions of Extropianism that reach a conclusion
<BR>
different from yours are irrational (or careless or slanderous)?
<BR>
(Now I think we're clear what's going on here!)&quot;?
<BR>
<P><P>Anyway, Max, I think you've started a great group that has
<BR>
brought together many interesting people, above all scientists
<BR>
and highly imaginative science fiction writers/fans. I think in
<BR>
the future I'll leave the philosophical, political, historical
<BR>
and sociological questions for the other X-humanist groups.
<BR>
<P>May we all be non-reactively self-reflective,
<BR>
Brian.
<BR>
<P>P.S.
