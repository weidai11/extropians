<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: Harvard and the Making of the Unabomber&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In the fall of 1958 Theodore Kaczynski, a brilliant but vulnerable boy of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sixteen, entered Harvard College. There he encountered a prevailing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;intellectual atmosphere of anti-technological despair. There, also, he was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;deceived into subjecting himself to a series of purposely brutalizing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;psychological experiments -- experiments that may have confirmed his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;still-forming belief in the evil of science. Was the Unabomber born at
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Harvard? A look inside the files

<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: L&gt;IKE many Harvard alumni, I sometimes wander the neighborhood
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;when I return to Cambridge, reminiscing about the old days and musing on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;how different my life has been from what I hoped and expected then. On a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;trip there last fall I found myself a few blocks north of Harvard Yard, on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Divinity Avenue. Near the end of this dead-end street sits the Peabody
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Museum -- a giant Victorian structure attached to the Botanical Museum,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;where my mother had taken me as a young boy, in 1943, to view the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;spectacular exhibit of glass flowers. These left such a vivid impression
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that a decade later my recollection of them inspired me, then a senior in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;high school, to apply to Harvard.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;This time my return was prompted not by nostalgia but by curiosity. No. 7
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Divinity Avenue is a modern multi-story academic building today, housing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the university's Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology. In 1959 a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;comfortable old house stood on the site. Known as the Annex, it served as a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;laboratory in which staff members of the Department of Social Relations
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conducted research on human subjects. There, from the fall of 1959 through
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the spring of 1962, Harvard psychologists, led by Henry A. Murray,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conducted a disturbing and what would now be seen as ethically indefensible
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment on twenty-two undergraduates. To preserve the anonymity of these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;student guinea pigs, experimenters referred to individuals by code name
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;only. One of these students, whom they dubbed &quot;Lawful,&quot; was Theodore John
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski, who would one day be known as the Unabomber, and who would later
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mail or deliver sixteen package bombs to scientists, academicians, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;others over seventeen years, killing three people and injuring
</EM><BR>
twenty-three.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: I&gt;HAD a special interest in Kaczynski. For many years he and I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;had lived parallel lives to some degree. Both of us had attended public
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;high schools and had then gone on to Harvard, from which I graduated in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;1957, he in 1962. At Harvard we took many of the same courses from the same
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;professors. We were both graduate students and assistant professors in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;1960s. I studied at Oxford and received a Ph.D. in philosophy from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Princeton before joining the faculty at Ohio State and later serving as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;chairman of the Department of Philosophy at Macalester College, in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Minnesota. Kaczynski earned a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Michigan in 1967 and then joined the Berkeley Department of Mathematics as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;an instructor. In the early 1970s, at roughly the same time, we separately
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fled civilization to the Montana wilderness.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In 1971 Kaczynski moved to Great Falls, Montana; that summer he began
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;building a cabin near the town of Lincoln, eighty miles southwest of Great
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Falls, on a lot he and his brother, David, had bought. In 1972 my wife and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I bought an old homestead fifty-five miles south of Great Falls. Three
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;years later we gave up our teaching jobs to live in Montana full-time. Our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;place had neither telephone nor electricity; it was ten miles from the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nearest neighbor. In winter we were snowbound for months at a time.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In our desire to leave civilization Kaczynski and I were not alone. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;others sought a similar escape. What, I wondered, had driven Kaczynski into
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the wilderness, and to murder? To what degree were his motives simply a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;more extreme form of the alienation that prompted so many of us to seek
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;solace in the backwoods?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Most of us may believe we already know Ted Kaczynski. According to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conventional wisdom, Kaczynski, a brilliant former professor of mathematics
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;turned Montana hermit and mail bomber, is, simply, mentally ill. He is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;paranoid schizophrenic, and there is nothing more about him to interest us.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;But the conventional wisdom is mistaken. I came to discover that Kaczynski
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;is neither the extreme loner he has been made out to be nor in any clinical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sense mentally ill. He is an intellectual and a convicted murderer, and to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;understand the connections between these two facts we must revisit his time
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;at Harvard.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I first heard of the Murray experiment from Kaczynski himself. We had begun
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;corresponding in July of 1998, a couple of months after a federal court in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sacramento sentenced him to life without possibility of parole. Kaczynski,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I quickly discovered, was an indefatigable correspondent. Sometimes his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;letters to me came so fast that it was difficult to answer one before the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;next arrived. The letters were written with great humor, intelligence, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;care. And, I found, he was in his own way a charming correspondent. He has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;apparently carried on a similarly voluminous correspondence with many
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;others, often developing close friendships with them through the mail.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski told me that the Henry A. Murray Research Center of the Radcliffe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Institute for Advanced Study, although it released some raw data about him
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to his attorneys, had refused to share information about the Murray team's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;analysis of that data. Kaczynski hinted darkly that the Murray Center
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;seemed to feel it had something to hide. One of his defense investigators,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;he said, reported that the center had told participating psychologists not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to talk with his defense team.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;After this intriguing start Kaczynski told me little more about the Murray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment than what I could find in the published literature. Henry
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray's widow, Nina, was friendly and cooperative, but could provide few
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;answers to my questions. Several of the research assistants I interviewed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;couldn't, or wouldn't, talk much about the study. Nor could the Murray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Center be entirely forthcoming. After considering my application, its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;research committee approved my request to view the records of this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment, the so-called data set, which referred to subjects by code
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;names only. But because Kaczynski's alias was by then known to some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;journalists, I was not permitted to view his records.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Through research at the Murray Center and in the Harvard archives I found
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that, among its other purposes, Henry Murray's experiment was intended to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;measure how people react under stress. Murray subjected his unwitting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students, including Kaczynski, to intensive interrogation -- what Murray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;himself called &quot;vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive&quot; attacks,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;assaulting his subjects' egos and most-cherished ideals and beliefs.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;My quest was specific -- to determine what effects, if any, the experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;may have had on Kaczynski. This was a subset of a larger question: What
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;effects had Harvard had on Kaczynski? In 1998, as he faced trial for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;murder, Kaczynski was examined by Sally Johnson, a forensic psychiatrist
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, at the order of a court. In her evaluation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Johnson wrote that Kaczynski &quot;has intertwined his two belief systems, that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;society is bad and he should rebel against it, and his intense anger at his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;family for his perceived injustices.&quot; The Unabomber was created when these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;two belief systems converged. And it was at Harvard, Johnson suggested,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that they first surfaced and met. She wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;During his college years he had fantasies of living a primitive life and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fantasized himself as &quot;an agitator, rousing mobs to frenzies of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;revolutionary violence.&quot; He claims that during that time he started to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;think about breaking away from normal society.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;It was at Harvard that Kaczynski first encountered the ideas about the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;evils of society that would provide a justification for and a focus to an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;anger he had felt since junior high school. It was at Harvard that he began
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to develop these ideas into his anti-technology ideology of revolution. It
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was at Harvard that Kaczynski began to have fantasies of revenge, began to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;dream of escaping into wilderness. And it was at Harvard, as far as can be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;determined, that he fixed on dualistic ideas of good and evil, and on a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mathematical cognitive style that led him to think he could find absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;truth through the application of his own reason. Was the Unabomber -- &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;most intellectual serial killer the nation has ever produced,&quot; as one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;criminologist has called him -- born at Harvard?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Manifesto
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: T&gt;HE story of Kaczynski's crimes began more than twenty-two years
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ago, but the chain of consequences they triggered has yet to run its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;course. Dubbed &quot;the Unabomber&quot; by the FBI because his early victims were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;associated with universities or airlines, Kaczynski conducted an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;increasingly lethal campaign of terrorism that began on May 26, 1978, when
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his first bomb slightly injured a Northwestern University public-safety
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;officer, Terry Marker, and ended on April 24, 1995, when a bomb he had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mailed killed the president of the California Forestry Association, Gilbert
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray. Yet until 1993 Kaczynski remained mute, and his intentions were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;entirely unknown.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;By 1995 his explosives had taken a leap in sophistication; that year he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;suddenly became loquacious, writing letters to newspapers, magazines,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;targets, and a victim. Two years later The Washington Post, in conjunction
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with The New York Times, published copies of the 35,000-word essay that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski titled &quot;Industrial Society and Its Future,&quot; and which the press
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;called &quot;The Manifesto.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Recognizing the manifesto as Kaczynski's writing, his brother, David,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;turned Kaczynski in to the FBI, which arrested him at his Montana cabin on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;April 3, 1996. Later that year Kaczynski was removed to California to stand
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;trial for, among other crimes, two Unabomber murders committed in that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;state. On January 8, 1998, having failed to dissuade his attorneys from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;their intention of presenting an insanity defense, and having failed to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;persuade the presiding judge, Garland E. Burrell Jr., to allow him to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;choose a new attorney, Kaczynski asked the court for permission to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;represent himself. In response Burrell ordered Sally Johnson to examine
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski, to determine if he was competent to direct his own defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Johnson offered a &quot;provisional&quot; diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, but
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;she concluded that Kaczynski was nevertheless competent to represent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;himself. Burrell refused to allow it. Faced with the prospect of a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;humiliating trial in which his attorneys would portray him as insane and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his philosophy as the ravings of a madman, Kaczynski capitulated: in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;exchange for the government's agreement not to seek the death penalty, he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;pleaded guilty to thirteen federal bombing offenses that killed three men
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and seriously injured two others, and acknowledged responsibility for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sixteen bombings from 1978 to 1995. On May 4, 1998, he was sentenced to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;life in prison without possibility of parole.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Driving these events from first bomb to plea bargain was Kaczynski's strong
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;desire to have his ideas -- as described in the manifesto -- taken
</EM><BR>
seriously.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences,&quot; Kaczynski's manifesto
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;begins, &quot;have been a disaster for the human race.&quot; They have led, it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;contends, to the growth of a technological system dependent on a social,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;economic, and political order that suppresses individual freedom and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;destroys nature. &quot;The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;needs. Instead, it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;needs of the system.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;By forcing people to conform to machines rather than vice versa, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;manifesto states, technology creates a sick society hostile to human
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;potential. Because technology demands constant change, it destroys local,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;human-scale communities. Because it requires a high degree of social and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;economic organization, it encourages the growth of crowded and unlivable
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;cities and of mega-states indifferent to the needs of citizens.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;This evolution toward a civilization increasingly dominated by technology
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and the power structure serving technology, the manifesto argues, cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;reversed on its own, because &quot;technology is a more powerful social force
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;than the aspiration for freedom,&quot; and because &quot;while technological progress
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;AS A WHOLE continually narrows our sphere of freedom, each new technical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;advance CONSIDERED BY ITSELF appears to be desirable.&quot; Hence science and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;technology constitute &quot;a mass power movement, and many scientists gratify
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;their need for power through identification with this mass movement.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Therefore &quot;the technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;into the unknown.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Because human beings must conform to the machine,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;our society tends to regard as a &quot;sickness&quot; any mode of thought or behavior
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that is inconvenient for the system, and this is plausible because when an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;individual doesn't fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;well as problems for the system. Thus the manipulation of an individual to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;adjust him to the system is seen as a &quot;cure&quot; for a &quot;sickness&quot; and therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;as good.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;This requirement, the manifesto continues, has given rise to a social
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;infrastructure dedicated to modifying behavior. This infrastructure
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;includes an array of government agencies with ever-expanding police powers,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;an out-of-control regulatory system that encourages the limitless
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;multiplication of laws, an education establishment that stresses
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conformism, ubiquitous television networks whose fare is essentially an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;electronic form of Valium, and a medical and psychological establishment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that promotes the indiscriminate use of mind-altering drugs.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Since the system threatens humanity's survival and cannot be reformed,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski argued, it must be destroyed. Indeed, the system will probably
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;collapse on its own, when the weight of human suffering it creates becomes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unbearable. But the longer it persists, the more devastating will be the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ultimate collapse. Hence &quot;revolutionaries&quot; like the Unabomber &quot;by hastening
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the onset of the breakdown will be reducing the extent of the disaster.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;We have no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of society,&quot; Kaczynski wrote. &quot;Our goal is only to destroy the existing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;form of society.&quot; But this movement does have a further goal. It is to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;protect &quot;wild nature,&quot; which is the opposite of technology. Admittedly,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;eliminating industrial society&quot; may have some &quot;negative consequences,&quot; but
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;well, you can't eat your cake and have it too.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: T&gt;HE Unabomber's manifesto was greeted in 1995 by many thoughtful
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;people as a work of genius, or at least profundity, and as quite sane. In
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The New York Times the environmental writer Kirkpatrick Sale wrote that the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Unabomber &quot;is a rational man and his principal beliefs are, if hardly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mainstream, entirely reasonable.&quot; In The Nation Sale declared that the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;manifesto's first sentence &quot;is absolutely crucial for the American public
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to understand and ought to be on the forefront of the nation's political
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;agenda.&quot; The science writer Robert Wright observed in Time magazine,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;There's a little bit of the unabomber in most of us.&quot; An essay in The New
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Yorker by Cynthia Ozick described the Unabomber as America's &quot;own
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Raskolnikov -- the appealing, appalling, and disturbingly visionary
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;murderer of 'Crime and Punishment,' Dostoyevsky's masterwork of 1866.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Ozick called the Unabomber a &quot;philosophical criminal of exceptional
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;intelligence and humanitarian purpose, who is driven to commit murder out
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of an uncompromising idealism.&quot; Sites devoted to the Unabomber multiplied
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on the Internet -- the Church of Euthanasia Freedom Club; Unapack, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Unabomber Political Action Committee; alt.fan.unabomber; Chuck's Unabomb
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Page; redacted.com; MetroActive; and Steve Hau's Rest Stop. The University
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of Colorado hosted a panel titled &quot;The Unabomber Had a Point.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;By 1997, however, when Kaczynski's trial opened, the view had shifted.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Although psychiatrists for the prosecution continued to cite the manifesto
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;as proof of Kaczynski's sanity, experts for the defense and many in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;media now viewed it as a symptom and a product of severe mental illness.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The document, they argued, revealed a paranoid mind. During the trial the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;press frequently quoted legal experts who attested to Kaczynski's insanity.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Gerald Lefcourt, then the president of the National Association of Criminal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Defense Lawyers, said the defendant was &quot;obviously disturbed.&quot; Donald
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Heller, a former federal prosecutor, said, &quot;This guy is not playing with a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;full deck.&quot; The writer Maggie Scarf suggested in The New Republic that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski suffered from &quot;Narcissistic Personality Disorder.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Michael Mello, a professor at Vermont Law School, is the author of The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;United States of America vs. Theodore John Kaczynski. He and William
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Finnegan, a writer for The New Yorker, have suggested that Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;brother, David, his mother, Wanda, and their lawyer, Tony Bisceglie, along
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with Kaczynski's defense attorneys, persuaded many in the media to portray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski as a paranoid schizophrenic. To a degree this is true. Anxious to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;save Kaczynski from execution, David and Wanda gave a succession of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;interviews from 1996 onward to The Washington Post, The New York Times, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sixty Minutes, among other outlets, in which they sought to portray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski as mentally disturbed and pathologically antisocial since
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;childhood. Meanwhile -- against his wishes and without his knowledge,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski insists -- his attorneys launched a mental-health defense for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;their client.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;One psychology expert for the defense, Karen Bronk Froming, concluded that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski exhibited a &quot;predisposition to schizophrenia.&quot; Another, David
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Vernon Foster, saw &quot;a clear and consistent picture of schizophrenia,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;paranoid type.&quot; Still another, Xavier F. Amador, described Kaczynski as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;typical of the hundreds of patients with schizophrenia.&quot; How did the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experts reach their conclusions? Although objective tests alone suggested
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to Froming only that Kaczynski's answers were &quot;consistent with&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;schizophrenia, she told Finnegan it was Kaczynski's writings -- in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;particular his &quot;anti-technology&quot; views -- that cemented this conclusion for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;her. Foster, who met with Kaczynski a few times but never formally examined
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;him, cited his &quot;delusional themes&quot; as evidence of sickness. Amador, who
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;never met Kaczynski at all, based his judgment on the &quot;delusional beliefs&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;he detected in Kaczynski's writing. And Sally Johnson's provisional
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;diagnosis -- that Kaczynski suffered from &quot;Paranoid Type&quot; schizophrenia --
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was largely based on her conviction that he harbored &quot;delusional beliefs&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;about the threats posed by technology. The experts also found evidence of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski's insanity in his refusal to accept their diagnoses or to help
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;them reach those diagnoses.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Most claims of mental illness rested on the diagnoses of experts whose
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;judgments, therefore, derived largely from their opinions of Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;philosophy and his personal habits -- he was a recluse, a wild man in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;appearance, a slob of a housekeeper, a celibate -- and from his refusal to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;admit he was ill. Thus Froming cited Kaczynski's &quot;unawareness of his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;disease&quot; as an indication of illness. Foster complained of the defendant's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;symptom-based failure to cooperate fully with psychiatric evaluation.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Amador said that the defendant suffered &quot;from severe deficits in awareness
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of illness.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;But Kaczynski was no more unkempt than many other people on our streets.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;His cabin was no messier than the offices of many college professors. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Montana wilds are filled with escapists like Kaczynski (and me). Celibacy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and misanthropy are not diseases. Nor was Kaczynski really so much of a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;recluse. Any reporter could quickly discover, as I did through interviews
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with scores of people who have known Kaczynski (classmates, teachers,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;neighbors), that he was not the extreme loner he has been made out to be.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And, surely, a refusal to admit to being insane or to cooperate with people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;who are paid to pronounce one insane cannot be taken seriously as proof of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;insanity.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Why were the media and the public so ready to dismiss Kaczynski as crazy?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski kept voluminous journals, and in one entry, apparently from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;before the bombing started, he anticipated this question.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I intend to start killing people. If I am successful at this, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;possible that, when I am caught (not alive, I fervently hope!) there will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;be some speculation in the news media as to my motives for killing.... If
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;some speculation occurs, they are bound to make me out to be a sickie, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to ascribe to me motives of a sordid or &quot;sick&quot; type. Of course, the term
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;sick&quot; in such a context represents a value judgment.... the news media may
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;have something to say about me when I am killed or caught. And they are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;bound to try to analyse my psychology and depict me as &quot;sick.&quot; This
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;powerful bias should be borne [in mind] in reading any attempts to analyse
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;my psychology.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Michael Mello suggests that the public wished to see Kaczynski as insane
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;because his ideas are too extreme for us to contemplate without discomfort.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;He challenges our most cherished beliefs. Mello writes,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The manifesto challenges the basic assumptions of virtually every interest
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;group that was involved with the case: the lawyers, the mental health
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experts, the press and politics -- both left and right.... Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;defense team convinced the media and the public that Kaczynski was crazy,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;even in the absence of credible evidence ... [because] we needed to believe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it.... They decided that the Unabomber was mentally ill, and his ideas were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mad. Then they forgot about the man and his ideas, and created a curative
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;tale.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Mello is only half right. It is true that many believed Kaczynski was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;insane because they needed to believe it. But the truly disturbing aspect
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of Kaczynski and his ideas is not that they are so foreign but that they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;are so familiar. The manifesto is the work of neither a genius nor a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;maniac. Except for its call to violence, the ideas it expresses are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;perfectly ordinary and unoriginal, shared by many Americans. Its pessimism
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;over the direction of civilization and its rejection of the modern world
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;are shared especially with the country's most highly educated. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;manifesto is, in other words, an academic -- and popular -- cliché. And if
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;concepts that many of us unreflectively accept can lead a person to commit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;serial murder, what does that say about us? We need to see Kaczynski as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;exceptional -- madman or genius -- because the alternative is so much more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;frightening.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Exceedingly Stable&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;

<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: N&gt;O. 8 Prescott Street in Cambridge is a well-preserved
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;three-story Victorian frame house, standing just outside Harvard Yard.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Today it houses Harvard's expository-writing program. But in September of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;1958, when Ted Kaczynski, just sixteen, arrived at Harvard, 8 Prescott
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Street was a more unusual place, a sort of incubator.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Earlier that year F. Skiddy von Stade Jr., Harvard's dean of freshmen, had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;decided to use the house as living accommodations for the brightest,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;youngest freshmen. Von Stade's well-intentioned idea was to provide these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;boys with a nurturing, intimate environment, so that they wouldn't feel
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;lost, as they might in the larger, less personal dorms. But in so doing he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;isolated the overly studious and less-mature boys from their classmates. He
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;inadvertently created a ghetto for grinds, making social adjustment for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;them more, rather than less, difficult.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;I lived at Prescott Street that year too,&quot; Michael Stucki told me
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;recently. &quot;And like Kaczynski, I was majoring in mathematics. Yet I swear I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;never ever even saw the guy.&quot; Stucki, who recently retired after a career
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in computers, lived alone on the top floor, far from Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ground-floor room. In the unsocial society of 8 Prescott, that was a big
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;distance. &quot;It was not unusual to spend all one's time in one's room and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;then rush out the door to library or class,&quot; Stucki said.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Francis Murphy, the Prescott Street proctor, was a graduate student who had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;studied for the Catholic priesthood, and to Kaczynski it seemed the house
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was intended to be run more like a monastery than a dorm. Whereas other
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;freshmen lived in suites with one or two roommates, six of the sixteen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students of Prescott Street, including Kaczynski, lived in single rooms.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;All but seven intended to major in a mathematical science. All but three
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;came from high schools outside New England, and therefore knew few people
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in Massachusetts. They were, in Murphy's words, &quot;a serious, quiet bunch.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Much has been made of Kaczynski's being a &quot;loner&quot; and of his having been
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;further isolated by Harvard's famed snobbism. Snobbism was indeed pervasive
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;at Harvard back then. A single false sartorial step could brand one an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;outcast. And Kaczynski looked shabby. He owned just two pairs of slacks and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;only a few shirts. Although he washed these each week in the coin-operated
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;machine in the basement of the house next door to 8 Prescott, they became
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;increasingly ragtag.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;But it is a mistake to exaggerate Kaczynski's isolation. Most public high
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;schoolers at Harvard in those days, including Kaczynski, viewed the tweedy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in-crowd as so many buttoned-down buffoons who did not realize how
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ridiculous they looked. And the evidence is that Kaczynski was neither
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;exceptionally a loner nor, at least in his early years at Harvard,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;alienated from the school or his peers.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Harvard was a &quot;tremendous thing for me,&quot; Kaczynski wrote in an unpublished
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;autobiography that he completed in 1998 and showed to me. &quot;I got something
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that I had been needing all along without knowing it, namely, hard work
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;requiring self-discipline and strenuous exercise of my abilities. I threw
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;myself into this.... I thrived on it.... Feeling the strength of my own
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;will, I became enthusiastic about will power.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Freshmen were required to participate in sports, so Kaczynski took up
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;swimming and then wrestling. He played the trombone, as he had in high
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;school, even joining the Harvard band (which he quit almost as soon as he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;learned that he would have to attend drill sessions). He played pickup
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;basketball. He made a few friends. One of his housemates, Gerald Burns,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;remembers sitting with Kaczynski in an all-night cafeteria, arguing about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the philosophy of Kant. After Kaczynski's arrest Burns wrote to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;anarchist journal Fifth Estate that Kaczynski &quot;was as normal as I am now:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it was [just] harder on him because he was much younger than his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;classmates.&quot; And indeed, most reports of his teachers, his academic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;adviser, his housemaster, and the health-services staff suggest that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski was in his first year at Harvard entirely balanced, although
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;tending to be a loner. The health-services doctor who interviewed Kaczynski
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;as part of the medical examination Harvard required for all freshmen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;observed,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Good impression created. Attractive, mature for age, relaxed.... Talks
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;easily, fluently and pleasantly.... likes people and gets on well with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;them. May have many acquaintances but makes his friends carefully. Prefers
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to be by himself part of the time at least. May be slightly shy....
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Essentially a practical and realistic planner and an efficient worker....
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Exceedingly stable, well integrated and feels secure within himself.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Usually very adaptable. May have many achievements and satisfactions.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The doctor further described Kaczynski thus: &quot;Pleasant young man who is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;below usual college entrance age. Apparently a good mathematician but seems
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to be gifted in this direction only. Plans not crystallized yet but this is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to be expected at his age. Is slightly shy and retiring but not to any
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;abnormal extent. Should be [a] steady worker.&quot;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Roots of the Unabomber
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: I&gt;N 1952, when Kaczynski was ten, his parents moved from Chicago
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to the suburban community of Evergreen Park -- in order, they later
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;explained to Ted, to provide him with a better class of friends. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;community into which the Kaczynskis moved would soon be in turmoil.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Evergreen Park was a mixed neighborhood of Irish, Italians, Czechs, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Poles who now felt themselves under siege by yet another group of new
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;arrivals.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Education of Topeka that segregated schooling was unconstitutional. To many
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;people in Evergreen Park this was tantamount to a declaration of war. Even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;before the Court's decision they had feared what they saw as black
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;encroachment. African-American communities stood just next door, and black
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;families came to town to shop and eat at Evergreen Park restaurants. Black
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;teenagers hung around Evergreen Plaza.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;This environment tended to isolate the Kaczynskis, who by several accounts
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were liberal on race matters. Aggravating their isolation was Evergreen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Park's fragmented school system. Until 1955 the town had no public high
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;school building, and students were bused to high schools in surrounding
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;communities. Evergreen Park High School was not completed until 1955, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Ted Kaczynski, who became a member of the first class that spent all four
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;years there, found himself in a school without cohesion or community, where
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;few of the students knew one another. As Spencer Gilmore, a former science
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;teacher, lamented, there was &quot;no commonality in the student body.&quot; Howard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Finkle, who was then a social-studies teacher, describes Evergreen Park in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;those years as a school for strangers. Soon the school was riven by
</EM><BR>
cliques.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Despite this fractured environment, school administrators sought to push
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the students hard academically. &quot;The fact to keep in mind about Evergreen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Park,&quot; Kaczynski's algebra teacher, Paul Jenkins, told me, &quot;is that Gene
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Howard [the principal of Evergreen Park High School at the time] enjoyed a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;big budget. He had combed the country for the best instructors he could
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;find -- folks who would be teaching junior college in most places. Yet most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of the kids were incredibly naive. Some had never even been to downtown
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Chicago. The faculty was presenting them with ideas they'd never
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;encountered before. Some hated the experience; others loved it. And it blew
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the minds of some, including perhaps Ted.&quot; The students, according to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Finkle, were asked to read books ordinarily used by college undergraduates.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The intellectually ambitious, like Kaczynski, adapted readily to these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;demands, but in a school where the most popular boys carried cigarette
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;packs rolled up in the sleeves of their T-shirts, excelling at academics
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;meant social exile.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;What pressures did Kaczynski face among his family? Ted Kaczynski insists
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that the Kaczynski home was an unhappy one and that his social isolation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;came about because his parents pushed him too hard academically. David and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Wanda say that theirs was a happy and normal home but that Ted had shown
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;signs of extreme alienation since childhood. When family members squabble,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it is almost impossible for anyone -- least of all an outsider -- to know
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;who is right. And the Kaczynskis are squabblers.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The letters and other materials Kaczynski sent me in the course of our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;correspondence -- including his 1998 autobiography, containing quotations
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;from doctors, teachers, and college advisers -- naturally support his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;version. Unfortunately, however, I am limited in my ability to use these,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;because Kaczynski has continually changed his mind about the terms and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conditions for the use of his autobiography and other documents.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Nevertheless, most of the people I interviewed tended to support most of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his claims. I offer my own interpretation of his family relations, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;supported by interviews and infused with knowledge of documents that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski sent to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski's father, Theodore R. &quot;Turk&quot; Kaczynski, was a self-educated
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;freethinker living in a conventionally Catholic working-class community. In
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his autobiography Kaczynski claims, and a close friend of Turk's confirms,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that Wanda tended to be fearful that their family would be perceived as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;different. Although nonconformist, the Kaczynskis wanted to be perceived as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conforming. Thus, Kaczynski records, although the Kaczynskis were atheists,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his parents instructed him to tell people they were Unitarians. The tension
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;created by the family's efforts to look good to the neighbors increased
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;significantly when, in the fifth grade, Kaczynski scored 167 on an IQ test.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;He skipped the sixth grade, leaving his friends behind to enter a new class
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;as the smallest kid in the room.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;From then on, according to Kaczynski and also according to others who knew
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the family, his parents valued his intellect as a trophy that gave the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynskis special status. They began to push him to study, lecturing him
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;if his report card showed any grade below an A. Meanwhile, Turk seemed --
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to Kaczynski, at least -- to become increasingly cold, critical, and
</EM><BR>
distant.
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When Kaczynski was a sophomore, the Evergreen Park High School
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;administration recommended that he skip his junior year. His band teacher
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and friend, James Oberto, remembers pleading with Kaczynski's father not to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;allow it. But Turk wouldn't listen. &quot;Ted's success meant too much to him,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Oberto says.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Two years younger than his classmates, and still small for his age,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski became even more of an outcast in school. There was &quot;a gradual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;increasing amount of hostility I had to face from the other kids,&quot; Sally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Johnson reports Kaczynski as admitting. &quot;By the time I left high school, I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was definitely regarded as a freak by a large segment of the student body.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Apparently caught between acrimony at home and rejection at school,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski countered with activity. He joined the chess, biology, German,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and mathematics clubs. He collected coins. He read ravenously and widely,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;excelling in every field from drama and history to biology and mathematics.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;According to an account in The Washington Post, he explored the music of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Bach, Vivaldi, and Gabrieli, studied music theory, and wrote musical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;compositions for a family trio -- David on the trumpet, Turk at the piano,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and himself on the trombone. He played duets with Oberto.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;These achievements made Kaczynski a favorite of his teachers. Virtually all
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;those with whom I talked who knew him well in those years saw him as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;studious and a member of the lowest-ranking high school clique -- the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;so-called briefcase boys -- but otherwise entirely normal. His physics
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;teacher, Robert Rippey, described him to me as &quot;honest, ethical, and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sociable.&quot; His American-government teacher, Philip Pemberton, said he had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;many friends and indeed seemed to be their &quot;ringleader.&quot; Paul Jenkins used
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski as a kind of teaching assistant, to help students who were having
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;trouble in math. School reports regularly gave him high marks for neatness,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;respect for others,&quot; &quot;courtesy,&quot; &quot;respect for law and order,&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;self-discipline. &quot;No one was more lavish in praise of Kaczynski than Lois
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Skillen, his high school counselor. &quot;Of all the youngsters I have worked
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with at the college level,&quot; she wrote to Harvard,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I believe Ted has one of the greatest contributions to make to society. He
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;is reflective, sensitive, and deeply conscious of his responsibilities to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;society.... His only drawback is a tendency to be rather quiet in his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;original meetings with people, but most adults on our staff, and many
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;people in the community who are mature find him easy to talk to, and very
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;challenging intellectually. He has a number of friends among high school
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students, and seems to influence them to think more seriously.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski was accepted by Harvard in the spring of 1958; he was not yet
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sixteen years old. One friend remembers urging Kaczynski's father not to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;let the boy go, arguing, &quot;He's too young, too immature, and Harvard too
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;impersonal.&quot; But again Turk wouldn't listen. &quot;Ted's going to Harvard was an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ego trip for him,&quot; the friend recalls.

</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;General Education and the Culture of Despair
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: A&gt;LL Harvard freshmen in the 1950s, including Kaczynski and me,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were immersed in what the college described as &quot;general education&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students called Gen Ed. This program of studies, which had been fully
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;implemented by 1950, was part of a nationwide curricular reform that sought
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to inculcate a sense of &quot;shared values&quot; among undergraduates through
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;instruction in the Judeo-Christian tradition.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Unlike the usual departmental offerings, which focused on methodological
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;issues within a discipline, Gen Ed courses were intended to be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;interdisciplinary, with material arranged for students historically
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;(chronologically) rather than analytically. Required Gen Ed courses focused
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on science, literature, philosophy, history, and Western institutions. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;undergraduate curriculum, therefore, was initially designed to be neatly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;divided into two categories, one general and one specialized, one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;emphasizing history and values, the other emphasizing the value-free
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;methodologies employed by scholars in the various academic fields. This
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;attempt at balance would give rise to a battle in the long war between
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;humanism and positivism.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;From the archives:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Wanted: American Radicals,&quot; by James Bryant Conant (May 1943)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;In this country we must invoke our radical ancestors and with their spirit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;attack the problems of a stratified society, highly mechanized and forced
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to continue along the road of mass production.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Education in the Western World,&quot; by James Bryant Conant (November 1957)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;I should like to approach the subject of education for the professions in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the mood of the comparative educationalist. I should like to examine in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;particular the way the future members of the professions are recruited,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;selected, and educated in certain European nations and the United States.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Gen Ed curriculum was born of a lofty impulse: to establish in higher
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;education -- as President Harry Truman's Commission on Higher Education
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;would later express it -- &quot;a code of behavior based on ethical principles
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;consistent with democratic ideals.&quot; Harvard's president, James B. Conant,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in his charge to the committee that would design Gen Ed, wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Unless the educational process includes at each level of maturity some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;continuing contact with those fields in which value judgments are of prime
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;importance, it must fall far short of the ideal. The student in high
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;school, in college and in graduate school must be concerned, in part at
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;least, with the words &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; in both the ethical and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mathematical sense.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The committee's report, General Education in a Free Society (1945), was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;known, for the color of its cover, as the Redbook. The solution that the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Redbook committee offered was a program of instruction that, in the words
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of the education historian Frederick Rudolph, called for &quot;a submersion in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;tradition and heritage and some sense of common bond strong enough to bring
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unbridled ego and ambition under control.&quot; The Redbook's program of reform
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;caught the imagination of educators across the country. By the mid-1950s
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;more than half the colleges in America were offering programs of general
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;education modeled along the same lines.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Although at Harvard the name caught on, the philosophy behind it did not.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Gen Ed was doomed from the start.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;By 1950 the Harvard faculty was divided between those who, chastened by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;their experience in World War II and especially by the bombings of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Hiroshima and Nagasaki, saw science and technology as a threat to Western
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;values and even human survival and those -- a majority -- who saw science
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;as a liberator from superstition and an avenue to progress. Both these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;views found their way into the Gen Ed curriculum.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The dominant faction had little sympathy for the Redbook's resolve to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;inculcate Judeo-Christian ethics. Because of the majority's resistance,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;many Redbook-committee recommendations were never fully implemented. And
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;those recommendations that were incorporated into the curriculum were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;quickly subverted by many of the people expected to teach it. These
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;professors in fact emphasized the opposite of the lesson Conant intended.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Rather than inculcate traditional values, they sought to undermine them.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Soon &quot;Thou shalt not utter a value judgment&quot; became the mantra for Harvard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;freshmen, in dorm bull sessions as well as in term papers. Positivism
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;triumphed.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Superficially, the positivist message appeared to be an optimistic one,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;concerning the perfectibility of science and the inevitability of progress.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;It taught that reason was a liberating force and faith mere superstition;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the advance of science would eventually produce a complete understanding of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nature. But positivism also taught that all the accumulated nonscientific
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;knowledge of the past, including the great religions and philosophies, had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;been at best merely an expression of &quot;cultural mores&quot; and at worst
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nonsense; life had no purpose and morality no justification.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Even as positivism preached progress, therefore, it subliminally carried --
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;quite in contradiction to the intent of Gen Ed's framers -- a more
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;disturbing implication: that absolute reason leads to absolute despair. G.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;K. Chesterton wrote, &quot;Imagination does not breed insanity. Exactly what
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;does breed insanity is reason. Poets do not go mad ... mathematicians go
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;mad.&quot; Hence Gen Ed delivered to those of us who were undergraduates during
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;this time a double whammy of pessimism. From the humanists we learned that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;science threatens civilization. From the scientists we learned that science
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;cannot be stopped. Taken together, they implied that there was no hope. Gen
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Ed had created at Harvard a culture of despair. This culture of despair was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;not, of course, confined to Harvard -- it was part of a more generalized
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;phenomenon among intellectuals all over the Western world. But it existed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;at Harvard in a particularly concentrated form, and Harvard was the place
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;where Kaczynski and I found ourselves.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Although I cannot say exactly what Kaczynski read, he must have absorbed a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;good measure of the Gen Ed readings that infused the intellectual and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;emotional climate on campus. Gen Ed courses in social science and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;philosophy quickly introduced us to the relativity of morals and the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;irrationality of religion. To establish that ethical standards were merely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;expressions of Western cultural mores, we were assigned to read works by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;anthropologists such as Margaret Mead (Coming of Age in Samoa) and Ruth
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Benedict (Patterns of Culture). In Humanities 5, or &quot;Ideas of Man and the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;World in Western Thought,&quot; we read Sigmund Freud's polemic against
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;religious faith, The Future of an Illusion, which dismisses the belief that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;life has purpose as a mere expression of infantile desires and as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;confirming that &quot;man is a creature of weak intelligence who is governed by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his instinctual wishes.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In expository writing we encountered Thorstein Veblen's prediction that &quot;so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;long as the machine process continues to hold its dominant place as a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;disciplinary factor in modern culture, so long must the spiritual and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;intellectual life of this cultural era maintain the character which the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;machine process gives it.&quot; We read Norbert Wiener, who warned that unless
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;human nature changes, the &quot;new industrial revolution ... [makes it]
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;practically certain that we shall have to face a decade or more of ruin and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;despair.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And Lewis Mumford told us,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Western man has exhausted the dream of mechanical power which so long
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;dominated his imagination.... he can no longer let himself remain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;spellbound in that dream: he must attach himself to more humane purposes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;than those he has given to the machine. We can no longer live, with the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;illusions of success, in a world given over to devitalized mechanisms,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;desocialized organisms, and depersonalized societies: a world that had lost
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;its sense of the ultimate dignity of the person.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In &quot;German R&quot; (&quot;Intermediate German With Review of Fundamentals&quot;), which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;both Kaczynski and I took, we encountered a whole corpus of pessimistic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;writers, from Friedrich Nietzsche (&quot;God is dead,&quot; &quot;Morality is the herd
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;instinct of the individual,&quot; &quot;The thought of suicide is a great source of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;comfort&quot;) to Oswald Spengler (&quot;This machine-technics will end with the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Faustian civilization and one day will lie in fragments, forgotten -- our
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;railways and steamships as dead as the Roman roads and the Chinese wall,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;our giant cities and skyscrapers in ruins like old Memphis and Babylon&quot;).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In several courses we studied Joseph Conrad, who would later become one of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski's favorite writers, and whose description of the villain in Heart
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of Darkness could have been applied to Kaczynski himself: &quot;All Europe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;contributed to the making of Kurtz.... &quot; He was &quot;a gifted creature.... He
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was a universal genius.&quot; Conrad's The Secret Agent, a satire about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;bomb-wielding anarchists who declare war on science (and whose intentional
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;irony Kaczynski may have missed), presages the Unabomber manifesto.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Science,&quot; one of the plotters suggests, &quot;is the sacrosanct fetish.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;All the damned professors are radicals at heart. Let them know that their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;great panjandrum has got to go, too.... The demonstration must be against
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;learning -- science.... The attack must have all the shocking senselessness
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of gratuitous blasphemy.... I have always dreamed of a band of men absolute
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in their resolve to discard all scruples in the choice of means, strong
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;enough to give themselves frankly the name of destroyers, and free from the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;taint of that resigned pessimism which rots the world. No pity for anything
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on earth, including themselves, and death enlisted for good and all in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;service of humanity -- that's what I would have liked to see.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: W&gt;HAT impact did this reading have on us? Speaking as a former
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;college professor, I can say that most curricula have absolutely no effect
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on most students. But readings can have profound effects on some students,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;especially the brightest, most conscientious, and least mature. Certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the intellectual climate generated by Gen Ed informed Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;developing views. The Unabomber philosophy bears a striking resemblance to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;many parts of Harvard's Gen Ed syllabus. Its anti-technology message and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;its despairing depiction of the sinister forces that lie beneath the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;surface of civilization, its emphasis on the alienation of the individual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and on the threat that science poses to human values -- all these were in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the readings. And these kinds of ideas did not affect Kaczynski alone --
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they reached an entire generation, and beyond.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Gen Ed had more than an intellectual impact. According to a study of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduates that included Kaczynski's class of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;1962, conducted by William G. Perry Jr., the director of the university's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Bureau of Study Counsel, the undergraduate curriculum had a profound impact
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on the emotions, the attitudes, and even the health of some students.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;According to Perry, intellectual development for Harvard and Radcliffe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;undergraduates typically encompassed a progression from a simplistic,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;dualistic&quot; view of reality to an increasingly relativistic and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;contingent&quot; one. Entering freshmen tend to favor simple over complex
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;solutions and to divide the world into truth and falsehood, good and bad,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;friend and foe. Yet in most of their college courses, especially in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;social sciences and the humanities, they are taught that truth is relative.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Most accept this, but a number cannot. They react against relativism by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;clinging more fiercely to an absolute view of the world. To some of these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students, in Perry's words, &quot;science and mathematics still seem to offer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;hope.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Nevertheless, Perry wrote, &quot;regression into dualism&quot; is not a happy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;development, for it &quot;calls for an enemy.&quot; Dualists in a relativistic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;environment tend to see themselves as surrounded; they become increasingly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;lonely and alienated. This attitude &quot;requires an equally absolutistic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;rejection of any 'establishment'&quot; and &quot;can call forth in its defense hate,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;projection, and denial of all distinctions but one,&quot; Perry wrote. &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;tendency ... is toward paranoia.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;As is evident in his writings, Kaczynski rejected the complexity and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;relativism he found in the humanities and the social sciences. He embraced
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;both the dualistic cognitive style of mathematics and Gen Ed's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;anti-technology message. And perhaps most important, he absorbed the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;message of positivism, which demanded value-neutral reasoning and preached
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that (as Kaczynski would later express it in his journal) &quot;there was no
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;logical justification for morality.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;After he graduated from Harvard, Kaczynski encountered a book by the French
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;philosopher Jacques Ellul, The Technological Society (1954). Its message
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was that mankind no longer saw technology as merely a tool but now pursued
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;its advancement as an end in itself. Society served technology, not vice
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;versa. Individuals were valued only insofar as they served this end. Their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;education and the structure of their institutions were shaped solely for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the purpose of technological progress.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;By the time he encountered Ellul, Kaczynski recalled in 1998, &quot;I had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;already developed at least 50% of the ideas of that book on my own, and ...
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;when I read the book for the first time, I was delighted, because I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;thought, 'Here is someone who is saying what I have already been
</EM><BR>
thinking.'&quot;
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Murray Experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: P&gt;ERHAPS no figure at Harvard at this time better embodied the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ongoing war between science and humanism than Henry A. &quot;Harry&quot; Murray, a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;professor in Harvard's Department of Social Relations. A wealthy and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;blue-blooded New Yorker, Murray was both a scientist and a humanist, and he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was one of Lewis Mumford's best friends. He feared for the future of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;civilization in an age of nuclear weapons, and advocated implementing the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;agenda of the World Federalist Association, which called for a single world
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;government. The atomic bomb, Murray wrote in a letter to Mumford, &quot;is the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;logical &amp; predictable result of the course we have been madly pursuing for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;a hundred years.&quot; The choice now facing humanity, he added, was &quot;One World
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;or No World.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Yet unlike Mumford, Murray maintained a deep faith in science. He saw it as
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;offering a solution by helping to transform the human personality. &quot;The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;kind of behavior that is required by the present threat,&quot; Murray wrote
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Mumford, &quot;involves transformations of personality such as never occurred
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;quickly in human history; one transformation being that of National Man
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;into World Man.&quot; Crucial to achieving this change was learning the secret
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of successful relationships between people, communities, and nations. And
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;coming to understand these &quot;unusually successful relations&quot; was the object
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of Murray's particular research: the interplay between two individuals,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;which he called the &quot;dyad.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The concept of the dyad was, in a sense, Murray's attempt to build a bridge
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;between psychology and sociology. Rather than follow Freud and Jung by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;identifying the individual as the fundamental atom in the psychological
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;universe, Murray chose the dyad -- the smallest social unit -- and in this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;way sought to unite psychiatry, which studied the psyches of individuals,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and sociology, which studied social relations. This kind of research, he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;apparently hoped, might (as he put it in a 1947 paper) promote &quot;the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;survival and further evaluation of Modern Man, &quot;by encouraging the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;emergence of the new &quot;world man&quot; and making world peace more likely.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray's interest in the dyad, however, may have been more than merely
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;academic. The curiosity of this complex man appears to have been impelled
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;by two motives -- one idealistic and the other somewhat less so. He lent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his talents to national aims during World War II. Forrest Robinson, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;author of a 1992 biography of Murray, wrote that during this period he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;flourished as a leader in the global crusade of good against evil.&quot; He was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;also an advocate of world government. Murray saw understanding the dyad, it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;seems, as a practical tool in the service of the great crusade in both its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;hot and cold phases. (He had long shown interest, for example, in the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;subject of brainwashing.) During the war Murray served in the Office of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping to develop
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;psychological screening tests for applicants and (according to Timothy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Leary) monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. In his book The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Search for the &quot;Manchurian Candidate&quot; (1979), John Marks reported that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;General &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan, the OSS director, &quot;called in Harvard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;psychology professor Henry 'Harry' Murray&quot; to devise a system for testing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the suitability of applicants to the OSS. Murray and his colleagues &quot;put
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;together an assessment system ... [that] tested a recruit's ability to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;stand up under pressure, to be a leader, to hold liquor, to lie skillfully,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and to read a person's character by the nature of his clothing.... Murray's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;system became a fixture in the OSS.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;One of the tests that Murray devised for the OSS was intended to determine
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;how well applicants withstood interrogations. As he and his colleagues
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;described it in their 1948 report &quot;Selection of Personnel for Clandestine
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Operations -- Assessment of Men,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The candidate immediately went downstairs to the basement room. A voice
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;from within commanded him to enter, and on complying he found himself
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;facing a spotlight strong enough to blind him for a moment. The room was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;otherwise dark. Behind the spotlight sat a scarcely discernible board of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;inquisitors.... The interrogator gruffly ordered the candidate to sit down.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When he did so, he discovered that the chair in which he sat was so
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;arranged that the full strength of the beam was focused directly on his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;face....
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;At first the questions were asked in a quiet, sympathetic, conciliatory
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;manner, to invite confidence.... After a few minutes, however, the examiner
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;worked up to a crescendo in a dramatic fashion.... When an inconsistency
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;appeared, he raised his voice and lashed out at the candidate, often with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sharp sarcasm. He might even roar, &quot;You're a liar.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Even anticipation of this test was enough to cause some applicants to fall
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;apart. The authors wrote that one person &quot;insisted he could not go through
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with the test.&quot; They continued, &quot;A little later the director ... found the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;candidate in his bedroom, sitting on the edge of his cot, sobbing.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Before the war Murray had been the director of the Harvard Psychological
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Clinic. After the war Murray returned to Harvard, where he continued to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;refine techniques of personality assessment. In 1948 he sent a grant
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;application to the Rockefeller Foundation proposing &quot;the development of a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;system of procedures for testing the suitability of officer candidates for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the navy.&quot; By 1950 he had resumed studies on Harvard undergraduates that he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;had begun, in rudimentary form, before the war, titled &quot;Multiform
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Assessments of Personality Development Among Gifted College Men.&quot; The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment in which Kaczynski participated was the last and most elaborate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in the series. In their postwar form these experiments focused on stressful
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;dyadic relations, designing confrontations akin to those mock
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;interrogations he had helped to orchestrate for the OSS.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;go to part one, part two, or part four.)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: P&gt;LANNING for the last of Murray's &quot;multiform assessments&quot; was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;well under way by the spring of 1959. The idea, according to Murray's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;notes, was to &quot;call for volunteers from a large undergraduate course.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Get about 80 sophomores; administer a series of scales or questionnaires
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;dealing with various dimensions of personality; pick 25 subjects, some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;extremely high, some extremely low and some in middle on each of these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;scales; study these 25 subjects over a three year period by the multiform
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;method of assessment; come up with 700 rank orders, and using a computer,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;obtain clusters of intercorrelations, factors, but final decisions are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;reached after prolonged discussions and reassessments; enormous amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;data which staff analyzes, interprets, formulates.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski told Mello that he was &quot;pressured into participating&quot; in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray experiment. His hesitation turned out to be sensible. Researchers
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;gave the volunteers almost no information about the experiment in which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they would participate. Each was simply asked to answer yes to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;following question: &quot;Would you be willing to contribute to the solution of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;certain psychological problems (parts of an on-going program of research in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the development of personality), by serving as a subject in a series of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiments or taking a number of tests (average about 2 hours a week)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;through the academic year (at the current College rate per hour)?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In fact it would never be clear what the &quot;certain psychological problems&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were. And the test that served as the centerpiece for this undertaking
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;appears remarkably similar to the old OSS stress test. Students would be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;given the third degree. But whereas the OSS applicants must have known that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;enduring unpleasant interrogations could be part of their job, these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students did not. The intent was to catch them by surprise, to deceive
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;them, and to brutalize them. As Murray described it,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;First, you are told you have a month in which to write a brief exposition
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of your personal philosophy of life, an affirmation of the major guiding
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;principles in accord with which you live or hope to live.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Second, when you return to the Annex with your finished composition, you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;are informed that in a day or two you and a talented young lawyer will be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;asked to debate the respective merits of your two philosophies.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When the subject arrived for the debate, he was escorted to a &quot;brilliantly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;lighted room&quot; and seated in front of a one-way mirror. A motion-picture
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;camera recorded his every move and facial expression through a hole in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;wall. Electrodes leading to machines that recorded his heart and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;respiratory rates were attached to his body. Then the debate began. But the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;students were tricked. Contrary to what Murray claimed in his article, they
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;had been led to believe that they would debate their philosophy of life
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with another student like themselves. Instead they confronted what Forrest
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Robinson describes as a &quot;well-prepared 'stooge'&quot; -- a talented young lawyer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;indeed, but one who had been instructed to launch into an aggressive attack
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on the subject, for the purpose of upsetting him as much as possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Robinson has described what happened next.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;As instructed, the unwitting subject attempted to represent and to defend
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his personal philosophy of life. Invariably, however, he was frustrated,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and finally brought to expressions of real anger, by the withering assault
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of his older, more sophisticated opponent.... while fluctuations in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;subject's pulse and respiration were measured on a cardiotachometer.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Not surprisingly, most participants found this highly unpleasant, even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;traumatic, as the data set records. &quot;We were led into the room with bright
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;lights, very bright,&quot; one of them, code-named Cringle, recalled afterward.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I could see shadowy activities going on behind the one-way glass ... [Dr.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;G] ... started fastening things on me. [I] had a sensation somewhat akin to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;someone being strapped on the electric chair with these electrodes ... I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;really started getting hit real hard ... Wham, wham, wham! And me getting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;hotter and more irritated and my heart beat going up ... and sweating
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;terribly ... there I was under the lights and with movie camera and all
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;this experimentation equipment on me ... It was sort of an unpleasant
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Right away,&quot; said another, code-named Trump, describing his experience
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;afterward, &quot;I didn't like [the interrogator].&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;[Dr. G] ... came waltzing over and he put on those electrodes but in that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;process, while he was doing that, kind of whistling, I was looking over the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;room, and right away I didn't like the room. I didn't like the way the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;glass was in front of me through which I couldn't see, but I was being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;watched and right away that puts one in a kind of unnatural situation and I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;noted the big white lights and again that heightens the unnatural effect.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;There was something peculiar about the set-up too, it was supposed to look
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;homey or look natural, two chairs and a little table, but again that struck
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;me as unnatural before the big piece of glass and the lights. And then [Mr.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;R] ... who was bubbling over, dancing around, started to talk to me about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;he liked my suit.... the buzzer would ring or something like that, we were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;supposed to begin.... he was being sarcastic or pretty much of a wise
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;guy.... And the first thing that entered my mind was to get up and ask him
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;outside immediately ... but that was out of the question, because the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;electrodes and the movie and all that ... I kind of sat there and began to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fume and then he went on and he got my goat and I couldn't think of what to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;say.... And then they came along and they took my electrodes off.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And so it went. One subject, Hinge, thought he was &quot;being attacked.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Another, Naisfield, complained, &quot;The lights were very bright.... Then the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;things were put on my legs and whatnot and on the arm, ... I didn't like
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the feel of the sticky stuff that was on there being sort of
</EM><BR>
uncomfortable.&quot;
<BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Although the &quot;stressful dyadic proceeding&quot; served as the centerpiece of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray's experiment (it occurred during the second year of the three-year
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;study), it was merely one among scores of different tests the students took
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in order to allow Murray and his associates to acquire, as Murray wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;the most accurate, significant, and complete knowledge and understanding
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of a single psychological event that is obtainable.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Before the dyadic confrontation took place, Murray and his colleagues
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;interviewed the students in depth about their hopes and aspirations. During
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;this same period the subjects were required to write not only essays
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;explaining their philosophies of life but also autobiographies, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they were told to answer specific, intimate questions on a range of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;subjects from thumb-sucking and toilet training to masturbation and erotic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fantasies. And they faced a battery of tests that included, among others,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the Thematic Apperception Test, a Rorschach test, the Minnesota Multiphasic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Personality Inventory, the California Psychological Inventory, a &quot;fantasy
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;inventory,&quot; a psychological-types inventory, the Maudalay Personality
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Inventory, an &quot;inventory of self-description,&quot; a &quot;temperament
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;questionnaire,&quot; a &quot;time-metaphor test,&quot; a &quot;basic disposition test,&quot; a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;range of experience inventory,&quot; a &quot;philosophical outlook test,&quot; a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;food-preference inventory, analyses of their literary tastes and moral
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;precepts, an &quot;odor association test,&quot; a &quot;word association test,&quot; an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;argument-completion test, a Wyatt finger-painting test, a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;projective-drawings test, and a &quot;Rosenzweig picture frustration test.&quot; The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;results were then analyzed by researchers, who plotted them in numerous
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ways in an effort to develop a psychological portrait of each personality
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in all its dimensions.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Only after most of this data had been collected did researchers administer
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the stressful dyadic confrontation. During the year following this session
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;each student was called back for several &quot;recall&quot; interviews and sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;was asked to comment on the movie of himself being reduced to impotent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;anger by the interrogator. During these replays, Murray wrote, &quot;you will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;see yourself making numerous grimaces and gestures&quot; and &quot;uttering
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;incongruent, disjunctive, and unfinished sentences.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;During the last year of the experiment Murray made the students available
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to his graduate-student assistants, to serve as guinea pigs for their own
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;research projects. By graduation, as Kenneth Keniston, one of these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;researchers, summarized the process later, &quot;each student had spent
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;approximately two hundred hours in the research, and had provided hundreds
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of pages of information about himself, his beliefs, his past life, his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;family, his college life and development, his fantasies, his hopes and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;dreams.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Why were the students willing to endure this ongoing stress and probing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;into their private lives? Some who had assisted Murray in the experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;confessed to me that they wondered about this themselves. But they -- and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;we -- can only speculate that some of the students (including Kaczynski)
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;did it for the money, that some (again, probably including Kaczynski) had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;doubts about their own psychic health and were seeking reassurance about
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;it, that some, suffering from Harvard's well-known anomie, were lonely and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;needed someone to talk to, and that some simply had an interest in helping
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to advance scientific knowledge. But in truth we do not know. Alden E.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Wessman, a former research associate of Murray's who has long been bothered
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;by the unethical dimension of this study, said to me recently, &quot;Later, I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;thought: 'We took and took and used them and what did we give them in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;return?'&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;What was the purpose of the experiment? Keniston told me that he wasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sure what the goals were. &quot;Murray was not the most systematic scientist,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;he explained. Murray himself gave curiously equivocal answers. At times he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;suggested that his intent was merely to gather as much raw data as possible
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;about one interpersonal event, which could then be used in different ways
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to help &quot;develop a theory of dyadic systems.&quot; At other times he recalled
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the idealistic goal of acquiring knowledge that would lead to improving
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;human personality development. At still other times his language seemed to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;suggest a continued interest in stressful interrogations. For example,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray explained in his &quot;Notes on Dyadic Research,&quot; dated March 16, 1959,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that an ongoing goal of the research, which focused heavily on &quot;degree of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;anxiety and disintegration,&quot; was to &quot;design and evaluate instruments and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;procedures for the prediction of how each subject will react in the course
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of a stressful dyadic proceeding.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sometimes Murray suggested that his research might have no value at all.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Cui bono?&quot; he once asked. &quot;As [the data] stand they are nothing but raw
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;data, meaningless as such; and the question is what meaning, what
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;intellectual news, can be extracted from them?&quot; In another context he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;asked, &quot;Are the costs in man-hours incurred by our elaborate, multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;procedures far greater than any possible gains in knowledge?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Such equivocation prompts one to ask, Could the experiment have had a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;purpose that Murray was reluctant to divulge? Was the multiform-assessments
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;project intended, at least in part, to help the CIA determine how to test,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;or break down, an individual's ability to withstand interrogation? The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;writer Alexander Cockburn has asked whether the students might have been
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;given the hallucinogenic drug LSD without their knowledge, possibly at the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;request of the CIA. By the late 1950s, according to some, Murray had become
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;quite interested in hallucinogenics, including LSD and psilocybin. And soon
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;after Murray's experiments on Kaczynski and his classmates were under way,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in 1960, Timothy Leary returned to Harvard and, with Murray's blessing,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;began his experiments with psilocybin. In his autobiography, Flashbacks
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;(1983), Leary, who would dedicate the rest of his life to promoting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;hallucinogenic drugs, described Murray as &quot;the wizard of personality
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;assessment who, as OSS chief psychologist, had monitored military
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiments on brainwashing and sodium amytal interrogation. Murray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;expressed great interest in our drug-research project and offered his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;support.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Forrest Robinson reports in his biography that Murray took psilocybin and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in 1961 delivered a talk on his experience to the International Congress of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Applied Psychology. That Leary had Murray's support was confirmed by Martin
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;A. Lee and Bruce Schlain in their book Acid Dreams: The Complete Social
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;History of LSD (1985).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Leary returned to Harvard and established a psilocybin research project
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with the approval of Dr. Harry Murray, chairman of the Department of Social
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Relations. Dr. Murray, who ran the Personality Assessments section of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;OSS during World War II, took a keen interest in Leary's work. He
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;volunteered for a psilocybin session, becoming one of the first of many
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;faculty and graduate students to sample the mushroom pill under Leary's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;guidance.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski thinks he was never given LSD. And after exhaustive research I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;could find no evidence that LSD was ever used in Murray's research.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Nevertheless, whether the research had a defense connection of some sort
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;remains an open question. Although direct evidence of support from a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;federal defense grant is so far lacking, circumstantial evidence exists:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the strong similarity between the OSS stress tests and the later
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiments, Murray's association with the OSS, his grant proposal to do
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;research for the Navy Department, and the lack of any clearly explained
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;purpose for the study. Obviously, the dyadic studies would have had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;considerable utility for the defense establishment, either as a framework
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;for testing recruits or as continuing work on how to improve interrogation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;techniques.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;A Turning Point
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: W&gt;HAT was the state of Kaczynski's mental health at the time of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the multiform-assessments project and immediately afterward? The evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;suggests that he was entirely sane during those years. By the spring of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;1998 Kaczynski had obtained from the Murray Center his answers (along with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;those of other Murray-experiment participants) on the Thematic Apperception
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Test, which Murray had given to Kaczynski during the first year of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment. At Kaczynski's request, his lawyers sent these to a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;psychological-testing expert: Bertram Karon, at Michigan State University.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Because participants were identified only by code names, Karon was able to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conduct a blind evaluation -- measuring the answers without knowing who had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;given them. Karon found that on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 a complete
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;absence of illness and 10 the highest degree of illness, &quot;Lawful&quot; scored 0
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;for &quot;Schizotypy&quot; and 2 for &quot;Psychopathy.&quot; Kaczynski's undergraduate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experience and behavior had been unremarkable. The reports of his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;housemaster, his adviser, and the university doctors attested to his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;normalcy, as did the observations of classmates. There is no evidence of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;immediate mental degradation in the project's aftermath. Emotional turmoil
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;is another matter. As Sally Johnson, the forensic psychiatrist, reported,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski clearly began to experience emotional distress then, and began to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;develop his anti-technology views.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And there is one thing that comes through clearly in the essays, test
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;answers, and interviews of Murray's subjects at the outset of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment: many of these young men already exhibited attitudes of anger,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nihilism, and alienation -- reflecting, perhaps, just how persuasively a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;culture of despair had infused student attitudes and suggesting that some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;might have been especially vulnerable to stress.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Bulwer admitted that &quot;right now I have sort of a nihilistic outlook on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;life.... How do you justify studying if you regard yourself as an ant
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;crawling through a great huge anthill with millions of others?&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Ives (speaking of living a conventional life) confessed,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And for doing all this I will hate myself. I mourn the world in which I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;live because for me there is no place unless I compromise. All I can do is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;gather up the shattered remains of my hope and love and in the debris of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the world keep at least one small blaze of poetry burning.... I most feel
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;akin to the artists and the philosophers and have a hatred for the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;scientists. The scientists I hate because they are pursuing goals which are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;destined to remove man even further from himself.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Naisfield averred, &quot;I don't feel that there is any purpose in my being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;alive ...&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;To describe his philosophy of life, Oscar (roughly) quoted Bertrand Russell
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;(whose writings were assigned in Gen Ed): &quot;Only on the firm foundation of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unyielding despair, can the soul's habitation henceforth be safely built.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Quartz announced that there were &quot;no such things as objective values.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Dorset wrote simply, &quot;Society as I see it stinks.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sanwick, as one researcher put it, is &quot;basically distrustful of the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;enterprise of life.&quot; Researchers found analyzing him &quot;almost impossible,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;because &quot;his whole life is conceptualized within a bombastic framework of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;philosophical concepts: being, life, death, transcendency, preservation,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;liberation, repetition, chaos.... One feels ... a great tumult and chaos of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;awarenesses, perceptions, and feelings.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The analysts deemed one subject &quot;a young man in a state of considerable
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;distress, depression, and confusion.... extremely alienated&quot; and another
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;prone to &quot;withdrawal, silence.&quot; And so on, and on.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;It is clear, also, that Murray's experiment deeply affected at least some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of its subjects. From interviews conducted after the project ended, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;apparent that certain students had found the experience searing. Even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;twenty-five years later some recalled the unpleasantness. In 1987 Cringle
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;remembered the &quot;anger and embarrassment ... the glass partition ... the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;electrodes and wires running up our sleeves.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Likewise, twenty-five years later Drill still had &quot;very vivid general
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;memories of the experience ... I remember someone putting electrodes and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;blood pressure counter on my arm just before the filming.... [I] was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;startled by [his interlocutor's] venom.... I remember responding with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unabating rage.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;What Hinge remembered most vividly twenty-five years later was being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;attacked&quot; and hating &quot;having all my movements and sounds recorded.... we
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were led over to the chairs and strapped in and as the wires were attached
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to us.... I began to get more involved in the situation and I began to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;realize that ... there I was, actually was going to be in front of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;movie camera ... I was surprised by how strongly he was attacking me....&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And twenty-five years later Locust wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I remember appearing one afternoon for a 'debate' and being hooked up to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;electrodes and sat in a chair with bright lights and being told a movie was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;being made.... I remember him attacking me, even insulting me, for my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;values, or for opinions I had expressed in my written material, and I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;remember feeling that I could not defend these ideas, that I had written
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;them not intended for them to be the subject of a debate ... I remember
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;being shocked by the severity of the attack, and I remember feeling
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;helpless to respond.... So what I seem to remember are feelings
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;(bewilderment, surprise, anger, chagrin) sensations (the bright lights used
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;for the filming, the discomfort of the arrangements) reactions (how could
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they have done this to me; what is the point of this? They have deceived
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;me, telling me there was going to be a discussion, when in fact there was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;an attack).
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;And at his twenty-fifth college reunion Ives wrote to Murray,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;My memories of the encounter 25 years ago ...
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The young lawyer was surprisingly hostile ...
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;He had wavey jet black hair ...
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The subject was the nature of love.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I argued that love could only be for a specific person.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;He argued that one could love all mankind.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;We talked about Natasha from WAR &amp; PEACE.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I did not enjoy the experience.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;We don't know what effect this experiment may have had on Kaczynski. As
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;noted, I did not have access to his records, and therefore cannot attest to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his degree of alienation then. Diana Baumrind, a psychologist at the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;University of California at Berkeley, observes that deceitful
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experimentation can be harmful if the subjects &quot;have been emotionally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unstable prior to the experiment.&quot; Kaczynski must certainly have been among
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the most vulnerable of Murray's experimental subjects -- a point that the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;researchers seem to have missed. He was among the youngest and the poorest
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of the group. He may have come from a dysfunctional home.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Lois Skillen, Kaczynski's high school counselor, is among those who believe
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that the Murray experiment could have been a turning point in Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;life. Ralph Meister, one of Turk Kaczynski's oldest friends and a retired
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;psychologist who has known Ted Kaczynski since he was a small boy, also
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;raises this possibility. So does one of Murray's own research associates.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The TAT results certainly suggest that at the outset of the experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski was mentally healthy, but by the experiment's end, judging from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Sally Johnson's comments, he was showing the first signs of emotional
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;distress.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;As Kaczynski's college life continued, outwardly he seemed to be adjusting
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to Harvard. But inwardly he increasingly seethed. According to Sally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Johnson, he began worrying about his health. He began having terrible
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nightmares. He started having fantasies about taking revenge against a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;society that he increasingly viewed as an evil force obsessed with imposing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conformism through psychological controls.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;These thoughts upset Kaczynski all the more because they exposed his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ineffectuality. Johnson reported that he would become horribly angry with
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;himself because he could not express this fury openly. &quot;I never attempted
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to put any such fantasies into effect,&quot; she quoted from his writings,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;because I was too strongly conditioned ... against any defiance of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;authority.... I could not have committed a crime of revenge even a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;relatively minor crime because ... my fear of being caught and punished was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;all out of proportion to the actual danger of being caught.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski felt that justice demanded that he take revenge on society. But
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;he lacked the personal resources at that time to do so. He was -- had
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;always been -- a good boy. Instead he would seek escape. He began to dream
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;about breaking away from society and living a primitive life. According to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Johnson, he &quot;began to study information about wild edible plants&quot; and to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;spend time learning about the wilderness. And like many American
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;intellectuals before him, from Henry David Thoreau to Edward Abbey, he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;began to form a plan to seek personal renewal in nature.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: T&gt;ODAY society would not tolerate the deceptions inherent in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Murray experiments. The researchers seem to have failed at least two
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;requirements in the American Psychological Association's current code of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;conduct: that they obtain &quot;informed consent&quot; from their subjects and that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they &quot;never deceive research participants about significant aspects that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;would affect their willingness to participate, such as physical risks,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;discomfort, or unpleasant emotional experiences.&quot; But different standards
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;prevailed then, and what we now view as the abuse of human subjects was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;common. Researchers around the country performed experiments on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;undergraduates that put them in psychological peril.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In an infamous experiment conducted in 1962 by the Yale professor Stanley
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Milgram, subjects (forty men recruited through mail solicitation and a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;newspaper ad) were led to believe that they were delivering
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ever-more-powerful electric shocks to a stranger, on orders from the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;researcher. Nearly two thirds of them continued to obey the orders even
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;when they were asked to administer the highest level of shock, labeled
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;Danger: Severe Shock.&quot; Some participants broke down on learning of their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;potential for cruelty. &quot;I observed a mature and initially poised
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;businessman enter the laboratory smiling and confident,&quot; Milgram wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;concerning one of his study subjects. &quot;Within 20 minutes he was reduced to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;a twitching, stuttering wreck, who was rapidly approaching a point of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nervous collapse.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;A 1971 experiment by the Stanford professor Philip Zimbardo embodied the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;pursuit of scientific truth at the expense of students' psychological
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;health. Zimbardo selected twenty-four students to play a game of guards and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;prisoners. Nine were &quot;arrested&quot; and taken to a basement &quot;prison,&quot; where
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;they were guarded by the others. In a very short time the guards began
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;abusing the prisoners. This sadism erupted so quickly that Zimbardo
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;discontinued the experiment after six days -- eight days earlier than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;originally intended.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Murray experiment may not have been as intensely traumatic as these
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;other experiments. And its ethics were definitely acceptable in their day.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;But the ethics of the day were wrong. And they framed Kaczynski's first
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;encounter with a reckless scientific value system that elevated the pursuit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of scientific truth above human rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;When, soon after, Kaczynski began to worry about the possibility of mind
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;control, he was not giving vent to paranoid delusions. In view of Murray's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment, he was not only rational but right. The university and the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;psychiatric establishment had been willing accomplices in an experiment
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;that had treated human beings as unwitting guinea pigs, and had treated
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;them brutally. Here is a powerful logical foundation for Kaczynski's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;latterly expressed conviction that academics, in particular scientists,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;were thoroughly compromised servants of &quot;the system,&quot; employed in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;development of techniques for the behavioral control of populations.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Unabomber
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: I&gt;T was the confluence of two streams of development that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;transformed Ted Kaczynski into the Unabomber. One stream was personal, fed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;by his anger toward his family and those who he felt had slighted or hurt
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;him, in high school and college. The other derived from his philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;critique of society and its institutions, and reflected the culture of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;despair he encountered at Harvard and later. The Murray experiment,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;containing both psychological and philosophical components, may well have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fed both streams.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Gradually, while he was immersed in his Harvard readings and in the Murray
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experiment, Kaczynski began to put together a theory to explain his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;unhappiness and anger. Technology and science were destroying liberty and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nature. The system, of which Harvard was a part, served technology, which
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in turn required conformism. By advertising, propaganda, and other
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;techniques of behavior modification, this system sought to transform men
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;into automatons, to serve the machine.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Thus did Kaczynski's Harvard experiences shape his anger and legitimize his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;wrath. By the time he graduated, all the elements that would ultimately
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;transform him into the Unabomber were in place -- the ideas out of which he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;would construct a philosophy, the unhappiness, the feelings of complete
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;isolation. Soon after, so, too, would be his commitment to killing.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Embracing the value-neutral message of Harvard's positivism -- morality was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;nonrational -- made him feel free to murder. Within four years of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;graduating from Harvard he would be firmly fixed in his life's plan.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;According to an autobiography he wrote that chronicled his life until the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;age of twenty-seven, &quot;I thought 'I will kill, but I will make at least some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;effort to avoid detection, so that I can kill again.'&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Both Kaczynski's philosophy and his decision to go into the wilderness were
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;set by the summer of 1966, after his fourth year as a graduate student at
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the University of Michigan (where, incidentally, students had rated him an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;above-average instructor). It was then, Sally Johnson wrote, that &quot;he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;decided that he would do what he always wanted to do, to go to Canada to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;take off in the woods with a rifle and try to live off the country. 'If it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;doesn't work and if I can get back to civilization before I starve then I
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;will come back here and kill someone I hate.'&quot; This was also when he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;decided to accept the teaching position at Berkeley -- not in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;launch an academic career but to earn a grubstake sufficient to support him
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in the wilderness.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;In 1971 Kaczynski wrote an essay containing most of the ideas that later
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;appeared in the manifesto. &quot;In these pages,&quot; it began, &quot;it is argued that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;continued scientific and technical progress will inevitably result in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;extinction of individual liberty.&quot; It was imperative that this juggernaut
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;be stopped, Kaczynski went on. This could not be done by simply
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;popularizing a certain libertarian philosophy&quot; unless &quot;that philosophy is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;accompanied by a program of concrete action.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;At that time Kaczynski still had some hope of achieving his goals by
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;peaceful means -- by establishing &quot;an organization dedicated to stopping
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;federal aid to scientific research.&quot; It would not be long before he decided
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;this was fruitless. The same year, Johnson wrote, he was &quot;thinking
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;seriously about and planning to murder a scientist.&quot; Meanwhile, he began to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;practice what radical environmentalists call &quot;monkeywrenching&quot; --
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sabotaging or stealing equipment and setting traps and stringing wires to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;harm intruders into his wilderness domain. Later in the 1970s he began
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;experimenting with explosives. In 1978 he launched his campaign of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;terrorism with the bomb that injured Terry Marker.

<EM> &gt;The Evils of Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: T&gt;ODAY Ted Kaczynski is serving four life terms in a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;maximum-security prison in Florence, Colorado. Out of sight, he is not out
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of play. His manifesto continues to be read at colleges around the country.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Through letters, he maintains relations with many people he knew before his
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;arrest. And although most Americans are morally repulsed by the Unabomber's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;terrorism, many accept his anti-technology views and silently tolerate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;extremist actions on behalf of saving &quot;wild nature.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski has attracted a large new following of admirers. Indeed, he has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;become an inspiration and a sort of leader in exile for the burgeoning
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;green anarchist&quot; movement. In a letter to me Kaczynski made clear that he
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;keeps in contact with other anarchists, including John Zerzan, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;intellectual leader of a circle of anarchists in Eugene, Oregon, who was
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;among the few people to visit Kaczynski while he was in jail in Sacramento,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;awaiting trial. According to The Boston Globe, Theresa Kintz, one of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Zerzan's fellow anarchists, was the first writer to whom Kaczynski granted
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;an interview after his arrest. Writing for the London-based Green
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Anarchist, Kintz quoted Kaczynski as saying, &quot;For those who realize the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;need to do away with the techno-industrial system, if you work for its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;collapse, in effect you are killing a lot of people.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Los Angeles Times has reported that last June, 200 of Zerzan's comrades
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;rioted in Eugene, smashing computers, breaking shop windows, throwing
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;bricks at cars, and injuring eight police officers. According to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Seattle Times, followers of Zerzan's also arrived in force at last
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;December's &quot;Battle of Seattle,&quot; at the World Trade Organization meeting,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;where they smashed shop windows, flattened tires, and dumped garbage cans
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;on the street.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski continues to comment approvingly on the violent exploits of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;environmental radicals. In a letter he wrote last year to the Denver
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;television reporter Rick Sallinger, he expressed his support for the Earth
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Liberation Front's arsons at the Vail ski resort -- fires that destroyed
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;more than $12 million worth of property.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;I fully approve of [the arson],&quot; he wrote Sallinger, &quot;and I congratulate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the people who carried it out.&quot; Kaczynski went on to commend an editorial
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in the Earth First! Journal by Kintz, who wrote, &quot;The Earth Liberation
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Front's eco-sabotage of Vail constituted a political act of conscience
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;perfectly in keeping with the sincere expression of the biocentric paradigm
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;many Earth First!ers espouse.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;It is unlikely that Kaczynski will someday be a free man again, but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;not impossible. Although he pleaded guilty in January of 1998 to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Unabomber crimes, that outcome is currently under appeal. He claims that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;his attorneys deceived him and acted against his wishes by preparing a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&quot;mental defect&quot; defense for him, and that by allowing this to happen, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;court violated his Sixth Amendment right to direct his own defense. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to hear his appeal, and a new trial is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;possibility.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Some, including me, believe that if Kaczynski does win a new trial, he will
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;argue that his killings were necessary in order to save the world from a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;great evil -- namely, technology. Most legal experts believe that this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;would be an unpersuasive and even suicidal defense strategy, leading
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;directly to a guilty verdict and a sentence of death. But apparently
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kaczynski would rather die a martyr for his ideas than live out his life in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;prison. At any rate, his essential point is correct: the Unabomber is not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;only a killer but a sane one. He is a terrorist, like Timothy McVeigh, the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Oklahoma City bomber, and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the World Trade Center
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;bomber. And like them, he is evil. But what kind of evil?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;&lt;Picture: T&gt;HE real story of Ted Kaczynski is one of the nature of modern
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;evil -- evil that results from the corrosive powers of intellect itself,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and its arrogant tendency to put ideas above common humanity. It stems from
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;our capacity to conceive theories or philosophies that promote violence or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;murder in order to avert supposed injustices or catastrophes, to acquiesce
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in historical necessity, or to find the final solution to the world's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;problems -- and by this process of abstraction to dehumanize our enemies.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;We become like Raskolnikov, in Crime and Punishment, who declares, &quot;I did
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;not kill a human being, but a principle!&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Guided by theories, philosophies, and ideologies, the worst mass killers of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;modern history transformed their victims into depersonalized abstractions,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;making them easier to kill. Much the way Stalin, citing Communist dogma,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;ordered the murder of millions of peasants toward &quot;the elimination of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Kulaks as a class,&quot; so Kaczynski rationalized his murders as necessary to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;solve &quot;the technology problem.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The conditions that produce violence continue to flourish. Despite their
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;historically unprecedented affluence, many middle-class Americans,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;particularly the educated elite, are still gripped by despair. The
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;education system continues to promote bleak visions of the future.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Meanwhile, alienating ideologies, offering the false promise of quick
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;solutions through violence, proliferate.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Although most Americans strongly condemn terrorist acts committed in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;name of political agendas of which they do not approve, many turn a blind
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;eye toward savagery done in the name of ideals they share. Indeed, many are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;reasonably comfortable with violence short of murder, as long as it's done
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;for a cause they support. It was easy for Americans to unite in condemning
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, because few approved of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the bombers' goals: the destruction of the state of Israel and of the U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;government. But some conservatives seem to be untroubled by anti-abortion
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;bombings or by the rise of armed militias, and some liberals consistently
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;condone or ignore the proliferation of terrorism putatively committed on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;behalf of animals or the environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Not surprisingly, then, ideologically inspired violence has become
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;increasingly commonplace -- tolerated and sometimes even praised. Just
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;after the bombing at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, The Wall Street Journal
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;noted that terrorism &quot;has become a part of life.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;According to the FBI, explosive and incendiary bombings doubled during the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;first four years of the 1990s. And although the number of such incidents
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;has declined slightly since that time, certain kinds of &quot;single-issue&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;terrorism -- including acts committed on behalf of Kaczynski's cause of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;choice, &quot;saving wild nature&quot; -- are becoming increasingly prominent. Last
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;year the director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, told Congress, &quot;The most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;recognizable single issue terrorists at the present time are those involved
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;in the violent animal rights, anti-abortion, and environmental protection
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;movements.... the potential for destruction has increased as terrorists
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;have turned toward large improvised explosive devices to inflict maximum
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;damage.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;After concluding a ten-month investigation of this phenomenon, the Portland
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Oregonian reported last fall,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Escalating sabotage to save the environment has inflicted tens of millions
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of dollars in damage and placed lives at risk.... Arsons, bombings and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;sabotage in the name of saving the environment and its creatures have swept
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;the American West over the last two decades, and Oregon is increasingly the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;center of it. At least 100 major acts of such violence have occurred since
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;1980, causing $42.8 million in damages.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;The Oregonian found that &quot;during the last four years alone, the West has
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;been rocked by 33 substantial incidents, with damages reaching $28.8
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;million.&quot; And although &quot;these crimes started nearly two decades ago -- some
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;seem clearly inspired by Edward Abbey's 1975 novel, The Monkey Wrench Gang
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;-- they have escalated dangerously, sometimes with the use of bombs, in the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;last six years.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;No one other than Kaczynski's three victims has yet been murdered by a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;fanatical environmentalist, but investigators consider it merely a matter
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of time before someone else is killed for similar reasons. &quot;I think we've
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;come very close to that line,&quot; one federal agent told the Oregonian, &quot;and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;we will cross that line unless we deal with this problem.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;We may cross that line sooner than we think. In a September, 1998, letter
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to me, Kaczynski wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I suspect that you underestimate the strength and depth of feeling against
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;industrial civilization that has been developing in recent years. I've been
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;surprised at some of the things that people have written to me. It looks to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;me as if our society is moving into a pre-revolutionary situation. (By that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;I don't mean a situation in which revolution is inevitable, but one in
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;which it is a realistic possibility.) The majority of people are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;pessimistic or cynical about existing institutions, there is widespread
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;alienation and directionlessness among young people.... Perhaps all that is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;needed is to give these forces appropriate organization and direction.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Seen from that perspective, it might seem that the rest of society is only
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;a few steps behind Kaczynski. When Henry Murray spoke of the need to create
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;a new &quot;World Man,&quot; this was not what he had in mind.
