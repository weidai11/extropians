Findings -- Developmentally disabled.
<BR>
The legislature finds that among those persons who endanger the safety of 
<BR>
others by committing crimes are a small number of persons with developmental 
<BR>
disabilities. While their conduct is not typical of the vast majority of 
<BR>
persons with developmental disabilities who are responsible citizens, for 
<BR>
their own welfare and for the safety of others the state may need to 
<BR>
exercise control over those few dangerous individuals who are 
<BR>
developmentally disabled, have been charged with crimes that involve a 
<BR>
threat to public safety or security, and have been found either incompetent 
<BR>
to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity. The legislature finds, 
<BR>
however, that the use of civil commitment procedures under chapter 71.05 RCW 
<BR>
to effect state control over dangerous developmentally disabled persons has 
<BR>
resulted in their commitment to institutions for the mentally ill. The 
<BR>
legislature finds that existing programs in mental institutions may be 
<BR>
inappropriate for persons who are developmentally disabled because the 
<BR>
services provided in mental institutions are oriented to persons with mental 
<BR>
illness, a condition not necessarily associated with developmental 
<BR>
disabilities. Therefore, the legislature believes that, where appropriate, 
<BR>
and subject to available funds, persons with developmental disabilities who 
<BR>
have been charged with crimes that involve a threat to public safety or 
<BR>
security and have been found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by 
<BR>
reason of insanity should receive state services addressing their needs, 
<BR>
that such services must be provided in conformance with an individual 
<BR>
habilitation plan, and that their initial treatment should be separate and 
<BR>
discrete from treatment for persons involved in any other treatment or 
<BR>
habilitation program in a manner consistent with the needs of public safety.

immediately [April 1, 1994].&quot; [1994 c 231 § 3.]
<BR>
Findings -- 1991 c 364: &quot;The legislature finds that the use of alcohol and 
<BR>
illicit drugs continues to be a primary crippler of our youth. This 
<BR>
translates into incredible costs to individuals, families, and society in 
<BR>
terms of traffic fatalities, suicides, criminal activity including 
<BR>
homicides, sexual promiscuity, familial incorrigibility, and conduct 
<BR>
disorders, and educational fallout. Among children of all socioeconomic 
<BR>
groups lower expectations for the future, low motivation and self-esteem, 
<BR>
alienation, and depression are associated with alcohol and drug abuse.
<BR>
Studies reveal that deaths from alcohol and other drug-related injuries rise 
<BR>
sharply through adolescence, peaking in the early twenties. But second peak 
<BR>
occurs in later life, where it accounts for three times as many deaths from 
<BR>
chronic diseases. A young victim's life expectancy is likely to be reduced 
<BR>
by an average of twenty-six years.
<BR>
Yet the cost of treating alcohol and drug addicts can be recouped in the 
<BR>
first three years of abstinence in health care savings alone. Public money 
<BR>
spent on treatment saves not only the life of the chemical abuser, it makes 
<BR>
us safer as individuals, and in the long-run costs less.
<BR>
The legislature further finds that many children who abuse alcohol and other 
<BR>
drugs may not require involuntary treatment, but still are not adequately 
<BR>
served. These children remain at risk for future chemical dependency, and 
<BR>
may become mentally ill or a juvenile offender or need out-of-home 
<BR>
placement. Children placed at risk because of chemical abuse may be better 
<BR>
served by the creation of a comprehensive integrated system for children in 
<BR>
crisis.
<BR>
The legislature declares that an emphasis on the treatment of youth will pay 
<BR>
the largest dividend in terms of preventable costs to individuals 
<BR>
themselves, their families, and to society. The provision of augmented 
<BR>
involuntary alcohol treatment services to youths, as well as involuntary 
<BR>
treatment for youths addicted by other drugs, is in the interest of the 
<BR>
public health and safety.&quot; [1991 c 364 § 7.]
<BR>
Construction -- 1991 c 364 §§ 7-12: &quot;The purpose of sections 7 through 12 of 
<BR>
this act is solely to provide authority for the involuntary commitment of 
<BR>
minors addicted by drugs within available funds and current programs and 
<BR>
facilities. Nothing in sections 7 through 12 of this act shall be construed 
<BR>
to require the addition of new facilities nor affect the department's 
<BR>
authority for the uses of existing programs and facilities authorized by 
<BR>
law. Nothing in sections 7 through 12 of this act shall prevent a parent or 
<BR>
guardian from requesting the involuntary commitment of a minor through a 
<BR>
county designated chemical dependency specialist on an ability to pay 
<BR>
basis.&quot; [1991 c 364 § 13.]
<BR>
Conflict with federal requirements -- 1991 c 364: &quot;If any part of this act 
<BR>
is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed 
<BR>
condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting 
<BR>
part of this act is inoperative solely to the extent of the conflict and 
<BR>
with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not 
<BR>
affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its application to the 
<BR>
agencies concerned. The rules under this act shall meet federal requirements 
<BR>
that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the 
<BR>
state.&quot; [1991 c 364 § 15.]
<BR>
Severability -- 1989 c 271: See note following RCW 9.94A.310.
