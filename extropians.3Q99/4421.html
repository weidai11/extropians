<i>&gt; !19990916  A patent on curry???  Indigenous people versus TRIPS</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     In November, the World Trade Organization is having a big meeting in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Seattle, and as we speak many organizations are planning protests,</i><br>
<i>&gt; basically from two points of views: American groups unhappy with WTO's</i><br>
<i>&gt; environmental decision making, and third world groups unhappy with</i><br>
<i>&gt; provisions in TRIPS that they feel lead to theft of bioresources from</i><br>
<i>&gt; their country (some of the groups protesting include the International</i><br>
<i>&gt; Forum on Globalization, www.ifg.org, the People for Fair Trade / NO to</i><br>
<i>&gt; WTO, www.seattlewto.org, and Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch,</i><br>
<i>&gt; www.tradewatch.org).</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The meeting is a classic example of money politics distorting</i><br>
<i>&gt; intellectual property policy making, much like the current patent reform</i><br>
<i>&gt; legislation in Congress, i.e., "if you have the big bucks, we will take</i><br>
<i>&gt; you seriously".  For example, for $250,000 donation, you can buy a ticket</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the opening and closing receptions, the "ministerial dinner", and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; business conference.  Where's my checkbook?  An article critical of WTO</i><br>
<i>&gt; and this meeting is at <a href="http://www.sfbg.com/News/33/50/50wto.html">http://www.sfbg.com/News/33/50/50wto.html</a>.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     Two items floating over the net illustrate the heated issues that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; still unresolved.  One conveys the unhappiness of many Indians over the</i><br>
<i>&gt; latest attempt to patent their cultural heritage, in this case, an attempt</i><br>
<i>&gt; to patent uses of curry.  The second is a third world petition protesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; aspects of TRIPS, in particular Article 27.3b, which they argue doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; provide enough protection to their countries to protest their indigenous</i><br>
<i>&gt; bioresources.</i><br>

<i>&gt; NOW CURRY PATENTS -- INDIA "UNPREPARED" FOR SEATTLE</i><br>
<i>&gt; By Ranjit Dev Raj</i><br>
<i>&gt; IPS News Bulletin, 15 Sep 1999, www.ips.org</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; NEW DELHI, Sep 15 (IPS) - It is enough to get Indians hot under the</i><br>
<i>&gt; collar.  Curry, that fiery, condiment-laden sauce, so essential to Indian</i><br>
<i>&gt; cuisine, is in danger of falling to Japanese patent hunters.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; There have been other overseas claimants to the ownership of curry. Not</i><br>
<i>&gt; long ago, the British Tourist Authority (BTA) declared it Britain's</i><br>
<i>&gt; national dish in acknowledgment of its phenomenal popularity among</i><br>
<i>&gt; restaurant clientele in London.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But the BTA was never so proprietorial about curry as Hirayama Makoto and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ohashi Sachiyo -- two enterprising Japanese who have a patent application</i><br>
<i>&gt; pending on the pungent preparation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If granted, the patent could give them exclusive rights to the process of</i><br>
<i>&gt; making curry: "by adding extracted spices to ingredients like cut and</i><br>
<i>&gt; processed onions, heating the mixture, adding curry powder and heating</i><br>
<i>&gt; until the mixture becomes viscous".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Devinder Sharma, an expert on food security and patent issues who blew the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whistle on the Japanese, warns that such piracy of traditional knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; is bound to increase in future thanks to poor initiatives by the Indian</i><br>
<i>&gt; government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "India and other developing countries desperately need to get their act</i><br>
<i>&gt; together before the 'Millennium Round' of the World Trade Organisation</i><br>
<i>&gt; (WTO)  in Seattle Nov. 30", Sharma said.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; So far, the government's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</i><br>
<i>&gt; (CSIR) has succeeding in getting cancelled patents taken out in the U.S on</i><br>
<i>&gt; turmeric (curcuma longa), a root used for centuries as 'grandma's remedy'</i><br>
<i>&gt; for healing wounds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But apart from that singular success, which CSIR has been crowing about,</i><br>
<i>&gt; India has watched helplessly as patents were taken out on processes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; products drawn from this country's vast storehouse of both traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge and biodiversity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, no less that 70 patents have been granted on the products of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the neem tree (azadirachta indica) which is native to Indian and whose</i><br>
<i>&gt; uses range from the treatment of fever, snake-bites, leprosy and as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; natural insecticide and disinfectant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The piracy list is long and includes the vegetable 'karela' (bitter gourd)</i><br>
<i>&gt; known to counter diabetes, urinary infection and arthritis but against</i><br>
<i>&gt; which the New York University has taken out two patents already.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; India's stakes are high because it happens to be one of the world's</i><br>
<i>&gt; richest biodiversity hotspots with over 81,000 species of recorded fauna</i><br>
<i>&gt; and 47,000 species of flora with 15,000 of the plant varieties unique to</i><br>
<i>&gt; this country.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Most ordinary Indians became aware of the real threats posed by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents regime, sought to be imposed under the General Agreement on Trade</i><br>
<i>&gt; and Tariffs (GATT), when a U.S company obtained, last year, patents on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; famed 'basmati' variety of rice grown only in India and Pakistan.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; They also became aware of the bumbling way in which the government has</i><br>
<i>&gt; been handling the patents issue responsible for emboldening biopirates and</i><br>
<i>&gt; patent buccaneers to lay outrageous claims to items whose origins were</i><br>
<i>&gt; thought indisputable.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In the five years since the signing of the GATT agreement at Marrakesh,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the government has lost substantial control over investment and trade with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the space steadily getting occupied by transnational corporations (TNCs)</i><br>
<i>&gt; and other interest groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; India has been dragged to the WTO Dispute Panel on at least 20 occasions</i><br>
<i>&gt; and lost most of the cases under what are called trade-distorting</i><br>
<i>&gt; subsidies while it cannot afford expensive legal battles in developed</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Vandana Shiva of the independent, Research Foundation for Science</i><br>
<i>&gt; Technology and Ecology (RFSTE) has pointed out that the "theft of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; basmati patent involved a theft of the intellectual and biodiversity</i><br>
<i>&gt; heritage of Indian farmers and traders and a deception of consumers".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But the government has had to stand by while other glaring commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt; thefts such as the use of the 'Darjeeling' label on tea which originated</i><br>
<i>&gt; in countries far away from the Himalayan district where the genuine item</i><br>
<i>&gt; grows.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; With just two months to go before the Seattle ministerial round, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; bureaucracy has finally begun preparatory work this week to formulate a</i><br>
<i>&gt; negotiating stand which is expected to oppose current emphasis on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; patents regime.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; "Virtually nothing has been done by way of preparation for a meeting that</i><br>
<i>&gt; would decide effectively whether India ranked among the poorest countries</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the world would ever be able to move out of the poverty trap ...",</i><br>
<i>&gt; complained Biplab Dasgupta a legislator and member of the Marxist</i><br>
<i>&gt; Communist Party of India.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dasgupta accused the government of deliberately steering away from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; national consensus on WTO issues and taking advantage of the current</i><br>
<i>&gt; political instability to formulate policies which may not be in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; country's best interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; India is currently engaged in a five-week long election to vote into power</i><br>
<i>&gt; its fifth government in three years - one which cannot be in office till</i><br>
<i>&gt; the second week of October leaving little time for any meaningful debate</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the issue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Ideally, Dasgupta said, the election should have been used as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; opportunity to initiate national debate on an issue which vitally concerns</i><br>
<i>&gt; the people.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; According to Dasgupta, it is important that India challenges the extension</i><br>
<i>&gt; of patenting to life forms under the Trade Related Intellectual Property</i><br>
<i>&gt; Rights (TRIPS) agreement which has resulted in a rush of bioprospecting in</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing countries by TNCs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; TRIPS is already in conflict with the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD)</i><br>
<i>&gt; since the latter asserts that intellectual property rights must not be in</i><br>
<i>&gt; conflict with conservation and sustainable use use of biodiversity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But India with its low 0.6 percent share in world trade has little real</i><br>
<i>&gt; negotiating power and has so far failed to take along other countries,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even its neighbours in South Asia, on issues of common interest such as</i><br>
<i>&gt; basmati and jute and tea prices.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What is more, India's two main national parties, the ruling Bharatiya</i><br>
<i>&gt; Janata Party and the opposition Congress seem little inclined to put up a</i><br>
<i>&gt; fight to protect India's economic interests.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In February, the two parties ensured passage of patent legislation which</i><br>
<i>&gt; not only granted granted exclusive marketing rights (EMRs) to drug and</i><br>
<i>&gt; agrochemical TNCs but also allowed them to poach on Indian traditional</i><br>
<i>&gt; medicine.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That legislation has since been challenged as unconstitutional in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Supreme Court by Shiva's RFSTE, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmer's</i><br>
<i>&gt; Union) and the People's Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), among others</i><br>
<i>&gt; leading activist and mass-based groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Last October, Indian negotiators agreed to abide by the Paris Convention</i><br>
<i>&gt; for the Protection of Industrial Property and Patent Cooperation Treaty,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the U.N patents agency, ignoring warnings by these groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This time the Indian delegation will reach Seattle without doing their</i><br>
<i>&gt; homework thanks to the "criminal indifference, if not actual complicity</i><br>
<i>&gt; with multinationals, on the part of the government", Dasgupta said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;                               ====================</i><br>
<i>&gt;     NO TO PATENTING OF LIFE!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;     INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' STATEMENT ON THE TRADE-RELATED</i><br>
<i>&gt;     ASPECTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS (TRIPS) OF THE WTO AGREEMENT</i><br>
<i>&gt;         Adopted in Geneva on 25 July 1999</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WE, INDIGENOUS PEOPLES from around the world, believe that nobody can own</i><br>
<i>&gt; what exists in nature except nature herself.  A human being cannot own its</i><br>
<i>&gt; own mother.  Humankind is part of Mother Nature, we have created nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; and so we can in no way claim to be owners of what does not belong to us.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But time and again, western legal property regimes have been imposed on</i><br>
<i>&gt; us, contradicting our own cosmologies and values.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WE VIEW with regret and anxiety how, Article 27.3b of the Trade-Related</i><br>
<i>&gt; Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) of the World Trade</i><br>
<i>&gt; Organization (WTO) Agreements will further denigrate and undermine our</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights to our cultural and intellectual heritage, our plant, animal, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; even human genetic resources and discriminate against our indigenous ways</i><br>
<i>&gt; of thinking and behaving. This Article makes an artificial distinction</i><br>
<i>&gt; between plants, animals, and micro-organisms and between "essentially</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological"  and "microbiological processes" for making plants and</i><br>
<i>&gt; animals. As far as we are concerned all these are life forms and life</i><br>
<i>&gt; creating processes which are sacred and which should not become the</i><br>
<i>&gt; subject of proprietary ownership.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WE KNOW that intellectual property rights as defined in the TRIPS</i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreement are monopoly rights given to individual or legal persons (e.g.</i><br>
<i>&gt; transnational corporations) who can prove that the inventions or</i><br>
<i>&gt; innovations they made are novel, involve an innovative step and are</i><br>
<i>&gt; capable of industrial application.  The application of this form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; property rights over living things as if they are mechanical or industrial</i><br>
<i>&gt; inventions is inappropriate. Indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage</i><br>
<i>&gt; are collectively and accretionally evolved through generations. Thus, no</i><br>
<i>&gt; single person can claim invention or discovery of medicinal plants, seeds</i><br>
<i>&gt; or other living things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The inherent conflict between these two knowledge systems and the manner</i><br>
<i>&gt; in which they are protected and used will cause further disintegration of</i><br>
<i>&gt; our communal values and practices.  It can also lead to infighting between</i><br>
<i>&gt; indigenous communities over who has ownership over a particular knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt; or innovation. Furthermore, it goes against the very essence of indigenous</i><br>
<i>&gt; spirituality which regards all creation as sacred.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; WE ARE AWARE of the various implications of the TRIPS Agreement on our</i><br>
<i>&gt; lives as indigenous peoples.  It will lead to the appropriation of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; traditional medicinal plants and seeds and our indigenous knowledge on</i><br>
<i>&gt; health, agriculture and biodiversity conservation.  It will undermine food</i><br>
<i>&gt; security, since the diversity and agricultural production on which our</i><br>
<i>&gt; communities depend would be eroded and would be controlled by individual,</i><br>
<i>&gt; private and foreign interests.  In addition, the TRIPS Agreement will</i><br>
<i>&gt; substantially weaken our access to and control over genetic and biological</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources; plunder our resources and territories; and contribute to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; deterioration of our quality of life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; IN THE REVIEW of the Article 27.3 (b) of the TRIPS Agreement, therefore,</i><br>
<i>&gt; our proposals are as follows:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This Article should be amended to categorically disallow the patenting of</i><br>
<i>&gt; life forms. Thus, the revised Article 27.3b should clearly prohibit the</i><br>
<i>&gt; patenting of plants and animals including all their parts, meaning, genes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; gene sequences, cells, proteins, seeds, etc. It should also prohibit the</i><br>
<i>&gt; patenting of natural processes involving the use of plants, animals and</i><br>
<i>&gt; other living organisms and their parts and processes used in producing</i><br>
<i>&gt; variations of plants, animals, and micro-organisms.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The provision for the protection of plant varieties by either a patent, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; sui generis system, or a combination of both should amended and elaborated</i><br>
<i>&gt; further: It should:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Disallow the use of patents to protect plant varieties.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Ensure that the sui generis system which may be created will</i><br>
<i>&gt;           protect the knowledge and innovations and practices in farming,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           agriculture, health and medical care, and conservation of</i><br>
<i>&gt;           biodiversity of indigenous peoples and farmers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Build upon the indigenous methods and customary laws protecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;           knowledge and heritage and biological resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Ensure that the protection offered to the indigenous and</i><br>
<i>&gt;           traditional innovation, knowledge, and practices are consistent</i><br>
<i>&gt;           with the Convention of Biological Diversity (i.e. Articles 8j,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           10c, 17.2, and 18.4) and the International Undertaking on Plant</i><br>
<i>&gt;           Genetic Resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Allow for the right of indigenous peoples and farmers to continue</i><br>
<i>&gt;           their traditional practices of saving, sharing, and exchanging</i><br>
<i>&gt;           seeds; and harvesting, cultivating, and using medicinal plants;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Prevent the appropriation, theft, and piracy of indigenous seeds,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           medicinal plants, and the knowledge around the use of these by</i><br>
<i>&gt;           researchers, academic institutions, and corporations, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Integrate the principle and practice of prior informed consent,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           which means that the consent of indigenous peoples as</i><br>
<i>&gt;           communities or as collectivities should be obtained before any</i><br>
<i>&gt;           research or collection of plants will be undertaken. The right</i><br>
<i>&gt;           of indigenous peoples to veto any bioprospecting activity should</i><br>
<i>&gt;           be guaranteed. Mechanisms to enforce prior informed consent</i><br>
<i>&gt;           should be installed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;   -       Prevent the destruction and conversion of indigenous peoples'</i><br>
<i>&gt;           lands which are rich in biodiversity through projects like mines,</i><br>
<i>&gt;           monocrop commercial plantations, dams, etc. and recognize the</i><br>
<i>&gt;           rights of indigenous peoples to these lands and territories.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We urge the WTO Member-States to put the amendment of the TRIPS Agreement</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a priority item in agenda of the forthcoming WTO Ministerial Conference</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Seattle. The implementation of the TRIPS Agreement in its present form</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have devastating social and environmental consequences which will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; irreversible. It is an imperative, therefore, that this Agreement be</i><br>
<i>&gt; amended to prohibit the patenting of lifeforms and the piracy of</i><br>
<i>&gt; indigenous peoples knowledge and resources.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We also call on all the WTO Member-States to work for the extension of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; deadline of the implementation of Article 27.3b of TRIPS to the year 2006,</i><br>
<i>&gt; five years after the completion of the review of this has been done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Finally, we reiterate our commitment to sustain our struggle to have our</i><br>
<i>&gt; rights to our intellectual and cultural heritage and our lands and</i><br>
<i>&gt; resources promoted and protected. We call on the WTO to become an</i><br>
<i>&gt; instrument in promoting our rights instead of enacting and imposing</i><br>
<i>&gt; Agreements which are violative or undermining our rights as distinct</i><br>
<i>&gt; peoples.</i><br>
