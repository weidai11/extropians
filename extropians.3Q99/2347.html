What about anti-mater(I'm not sure about the spelling).
I read on cnn I guess they found anti matter particles in the space with a
baloon made by japanese.

<a href="2160.html#2347qlink5">&gt;RBCC is a candidate as the primary propulsion for a third-generation space </a><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Aerojet is proud to be working closely with MSFC as it moves forward on </i><br>

<i>&gt;the capability for early demonstration of a vehicle powered by an RBCC </i><br>
<i>&gt;engine," said Bob Harris, vice president, Strategic and Space Propulsion.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since 1996, Aerojet has successfully progressed in building the Strutjet </i><br>
<i>&gt;RBCC, which is part of MSFC's Advanced Reusable Technologies Project. This </i><br>
<i>&gt;contract extension will refine the Strutjet RBCC into a highly integrated </i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Strutjet RBCC is an advanced, hydrogen-fueled engine that combines the </i><br>
<i>&gt;best elements of air-breathing and rocket propulsion. It operates initially </i><br>
<i>&gt;as an air-augmented rocket as it accelerates to low supersonic speeds, </i><br>
<i>&gt;transitions to ramjet operation by turning off the rockets, then converts to </i><br>
<i>&gt;a scramjet as flight speed increases. The rockets are turned back on as </i><br>
<i>&gt;atmospheric oxygen diminishes, then the engine transitions to a </i><br>
<i>&gt;high-expansion rocket for final ascent.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;During the initial program phase, the Strutjet RBCC demonstrated superior </i><br>
<i>&gt;performance and a robust operating capability in wind tunnel tests over the </i><br>
<i>&gt;entire flight operating range. Also, Aerojet's patented cascade fuel</i><br>
injector

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Aerojet, a leading proponent of RBCC propulsion, has demonstrated excellent </i><br>

<i>&gt;the flexibility of this engine. Aided by Aerojet technology advances on this </i><br>
<i>&gt;program, NASA placed recent emphasis on continuing the advancement of this </i><br>

<i>&gt;Washington - August 12, 1999 - Researchers at NASA'ss Glenn Research Center </i><br>
<i>&gt;have made for the first time tiny particles of frozen hydrogen suspended in </i><br>
<i>&gt;liquid helium, a first step towards new rocket fuels that could</i><br>
revolutionize 
<br>
<a href="2160.html#2347qlink10">&gt;rocket propulsion technology.</a><br>
<i>&gt;In the experiments, small amounts of liquid hydrogen were poured onto the </i><br>
<i>&gt;surface of liquid helium. The liquid hydrogen was at a temperature of 14 </i><br>
<i>&gt;kelvins (minus 435 degrees F), just above freezing point; and the liquid </i><br>
<i>&gt;helium was held at 4 kelvins (minus 452 degrees F), or just above absolute </i><br>
<i>&gt;zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As the liquid hydrogen fell toward the surface of the helium, small, solid </i><br>
<i>&gt;hydrogen particles formed and then floated on the surface of the helium.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The suspension will be used to make futuristic atomic fuels that take </i><br>
<i>&gt;advantage of the chemical recombination of atoms into molecules.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Atomic fuels will make possible rockets with liftoff weights one-fifth that </i><br>
<i>&gt;of today's or with payloads three to four times more massive," said Bryan </i><br>
<i>&gt;Palaszewski, Glenn principal investigator for the experiment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Using atomic fuels could reduce or eliminate on-orbit assembly of large</i><br>
space 
<br>
<a href="2160.html#2347qlink11">&gt;vehicles, thereby eliminating multiple launches and years of assembly time </a><br>
<i>&gt;and making flights to all parts of the solar system less expensive and more </i><br>
<i>&gt;practicable.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In atomic fuels, atoms of very active elements would be stored in a medium </i><br>
<i>&gt;that prevents their recombination. Solid molecular hydrogen is a promising </i><br>
<i>&gt;medium for storing and keeping atoms separate because it becomes solid at </i><br>
<i>&gt;temperatures just a few degrees above absolute zero, where atomic activity </i><br>
<i>&gt;due to heat is at a minimum.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Helium, in turn, is the ideal medium for creating and holding the solid </i><br>
<i>&gt;hydrogen particles because it remains liquid below the freezing point of </i><br>
<i>&gt;hydrogen. In the rocket's reaction chamber, or engine, the fuel would warm, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and the atoms would be freed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In less than an instant, they would recombine into molecules, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;temperatures would go from 4 to 2000 kelvins (minus 452 to 3140 degrees F). </i><br>
<i>&gt;Both hydrogen and helium would instantly vaporize and shoot out of the</i><br>
engine 
<br>
<a href="2160.html#2347qlink12">&gt;at tremendous speed, propelling the rocket forward. </a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;Fusion fuels dreams of space travel</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Concepts could yield new propulsion techniques in a few years Terry Kammash, </i><br>
<i>&gt;an astrophysicist and engineer at the University of Michigan, is developing </i><br>
<i>&gt;a concept for a gas-dynamic mirror fusion propulsion engine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;By Anne Rueter</i><br>
<i>&gt;NEWHOUSE NEWS SERVICE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;ANN ARBOR, Mich., Aug. 11-To Terry Kammash, going to the stars is not sci-fi </i><br>
<i>&gt;stuff. In the new millennium, the nuclear engineer envisions missions to </i><br>
<i>&gt;Alpha Centauri, closest star to our solar system. In just the next 20 to 25 </i><br>
<i>&gt;years, he predicts spacecraft will reach one milepost on the route, the Oort </i><br>
<i>&gt;Cloud, a debris-filled comet belt 932 billion miles away. And he’s betting </i><br>
<i>&gt;the missions will use fusion, the basic energy source of stars themselves.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;NEVER MIND that efficient fusion reactors to power industry and light our </i><br>
<i>&gt;homes have so far eluded scientists and engineers. Kammash has designed two </i><br>
<i>&gt;propulsion engines that take one of fusion’s serious flaws and turn it into </i><br>
<i>&gt;an asset for space travel. And as scientists search for ways to explore the </i><br>
<i>&gt;vast distances in space, Kammash’s most developed design looks like a </i><br>
<i>&gt;front-runner.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The physics is well understood, the technology is available, said Kammash, a </i><br>
<i>&gt;University of Michigan professor emeritus. It’s just a question of putting </i><br>
<i>&gt;it together.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;That’s what NASA scientists have been doing at the Marshall Space Flight </i><br>
<i>&gt;Center in Huntsville, Ala., where several alternatives to chemical rockets </i><br>
<i>&gt;are being explored. Kammash’s concept is the furthest along, said Bill </i><br>
<i>&gt;Emrich, a senior engineer at the center. He’s getting a working model ready </i><br>
<i>&gt;to test the design the first such test of fusion propulsion for use in </i><br>
<i>&gt;space.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I think it’s a reasonably promising (concept), although there are others </i><br>
<i>&gt;that look promising too, Emrich said. It’s hard to say at this point which </i><br>
<i>&gt;one is going to be the winner.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;FUSION IN A YEAR OR TWO?</i><br>
<i>&gt;Kammash’s gas-dynamic mirror engine holds promise for faster travel to </i><br>
<i>&gt;planets such as Mars and Pluto. Emrich and other NASA scientists have </i><br>
<i>&gt;electromagnets in place in a 2-meter-long model of the engine. In the next </i><br>
<i>&gt;few months, they hope to start injecting plasma, the superheated fuel that </i><br>
<i>&gt;the magnets are designed to confine long enough to produce nuclear fusion </i><br>
<i>&gt;reactions. The scientists hope to achieve fusion during the next year or </i><br>
<i>&gt;two.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Meanwhile, Kammash is pushing forward with his second engine design, one </i><br>
<i>&gt;with the thrust needed for more distant interstellar missions. He got a </i><br>
<i>&gt;boost recently when this design was among a handful of propulsion ideas to </i><br>
<i>&gt;receive funding from NASA’s newly formed Institute for Advanced Concepts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Both engines, Kammash said, aim to cut to a realistic level the time and </i><br>
<i>&gt;cost of missions to planets in our solar system and beyond. And time is of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the essence. Using conventional chemical rockets, missions to Mars are long </i><br>
<i>&gt;enough to be daunting for humans: At seven to nine months each way, a trip </i><br>
<i>&gt;might last two years. At a typical shuttle speed of 17,600 mph, it would </i><br>
<i>&gt;take 168,000 years or more for a robotic mission to reach Alpha Centauri.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2160.html#2347qlink16">&gt;Kammash estimates his gas-dynamic mirror fusion propulsion engine would take </a><br>
<i>&gt;three to four months to travel to Mars and back. He thinks his newer design, </i><br>
<i>&gt;fast enough for interstellar missions, could reach Alpha Centauri, 259 </i><br>
<i>&gt;trillion miles away, in as little as 213 years. This new engine might take a </i><br>
<i>&gt;mere 29 years to make a one-way trip to the Oort Cloud.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now it costs $10,000 to put a kilogram in space, Kammash said. He and other </i><br>
<i>&gt;space scientists take seriously NASA’s challenge to cut this figure to </i><br>
<i>&gt;$2,000 or less. Alternative propulsion methods are key because conventional </i><br>
<i>&gt;fuels for long missions are extremely bulky and costly. It takes huge </i><br>
<i>&gt;amounts of fuel to lift a spacecraft into space if it must carry fuel to </i><br>
<i>&gt;travel to distant planets or stars.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;OTHER OPTIONS</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fusion energy, produced when the light nuclei of certain atoms fuse together </i><br>
<i>&gt;under intense heat, is not the only energy source being eyed for </i><br>
<i>&gt;long-distance space missions. Energy from fission, the splitting of heavy </i><br>
<i>&gt;atoms, is still a contender. Fission rockets, though they evoke safety </i><br>
<i>&gt;concerns, haven’t been abandoned and could power missions to the relatively </i><br>
<i>&gt;near moon and Mars. For more distant ones, scientists believe fusion has </i><br>
<i>&gt;greater potential.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea of a robotic mission to explore the environs of Alpha Centauri </i><br>
<i>&gt;draws many skeptics, but also many restless minds eager to try. If man does </i><br>
<i>&gt;not explore he becomes stagnant, civilization becomes stagnant, Kammash </i><br>
<i>&gt;said.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Streams of leaking energy are one reason fusion hasn’t lived up to hopes as </i><br>
<i>&gt;an energy source on Earth. Some fusion reactors have had trouble producing </i><br>
<i>&gt;more energy than they lose because hot plasma, the system’s fuel, is hard to </i><br>
<i>&gt;contain. Kammash worked on designs for such fusion reactors for decades. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Fusion enthusiasm ran high in the late 1970s and early ’80s; now Congress </i><br>
<i>&gt;continues to reduce funds for fusion research.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the early 1990s, Kammash came to see possibilities in fusion’s problems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;You want to eject hot plasma because that’s propulsion, Kammash said. Fusion </i><br>
<i>&gt;is inherently leaky, so let’s take advantage of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The gas-dynamic mirror engine relies on powerful magnets to create </i><br>
<i>&gt;electromagnetic fields that will confine plasma particles long enough for </i><br>
<i>&gt;sufficient fusion reactions to occur. Mirror refers to the magnetic fields </i><br>
<i>&gt;at each end that bounce particles back and forth. The engine retains some of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the plasma to keep the fusion reaction going, and lets a fraction of it </i><br>
<i>&gt;escape through a nozzle to produce thrust.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;THE ANTIMATTER FACTOR</i><br>
<i>&gt;The second engine, called MICF (Magnetically Insulated Inertial Confinement </i><br>
<i>&gt;Fusion), uses a different method to achieve fusion. A laser beam zaps </i><br>
<i>&gt;BB-sized pellets of fuel, creating a hot plasma contained by a metallic </i><br>
<i>&gt;shell. The plasma should be contained long enough to lead to large energy </i><br>
<i>&gt;gains, Kammash writes in Ad Astra, a magazine read by astronauts and other </i><br>
<i>&gt;space enthusiasts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;His idea is a concept that brings together antimatter and fusion propulsion, </i><br>
<i>&gt;said Robert Cassanova, director of the Institute for Advanced Concepts. We </i><br>

<p>
<a href="2160.html#2347qlink17">&gt;found that intriguing.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Instead of a laser, Kammash ultimately wants to use antimatter, an </i><br>
<i>&gt;experimental technique, to zap the fuel pellets. Giant particle accelerators </i><br>
<i>&gt;produce fleeting forms of antimatter. Scientists are trying to find ways to </i><br>
<i>&gt;trap one form, antiprotons, and use the energy they produce. Using a stream </i><br>
<i>&gt;of antiprotons instead of a bulky laser apparatus would make Kammash’s </i><br>
<i>&gt;design very attractive in space.</i><br>
