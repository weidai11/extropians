The following are quotes from Admiral Thomas H. Moorer:<br>
_______________________________________________________<br>
<p>
   Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of <br>
   Staff, Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, USN, Ret.<br>
<p>
<p>
July 17, 1998, will mark the second anniversary of the <br>
mysterious crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long <br>
Island, killing 230 men, women and children. ...<br>
<p>
The FBI and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)<br>
... theory is that the crash was initiated by an explosion <br>
of fuel in the plane's center tank, but the evidence they <br>
cite to support this is so weak that many people have <br>
been unwilling to accept it.<br>
<p>
As a former Navy aviator and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs <br>
of Staff, I am puzzled and disturbed by the inconclusive <br>
results of this investigation. Blaming the crash on an <br>
explosion in the fuel tank does not ring true for several <br>
reasons. First of all, modern aviation fuel is designed <br>
for safety. It does not readily burn, much less explode. <br>
There is no precedent for a mid-air fuel tank explosion <br>
in a modern jet airliner using Jet A-1 fuel without the <br>
involvement of a high explosive device.<br>
<p>
The NTSB searched long and hard for evidence that some-<br>
thing in the center wing tank of TWA Flight 800 had created <br>
a spark that set off a powerful explosion in the nearly <br>
empty tank. They could find nothing that would have <br>
generated such a spark.<br>
<p>
And unless the fuel was heated to at least 127 degrees <br>
Fahrenheit at sea level, you couldn't burn it with a match. <br>
That is why these modern jets using modern fuel have flown <br>
billions of miles with never an accident of this type un-<br>
less a high explosive was involved.<br>
<p>
There is no doubt that there was an explosion in the center <br>
wing fuel tank of TWA Flight 800, but the evidence indicates <br>
that it was the result of the explosion of a powerful missile <br>
outside the tank. <br>
<p>
<p>
... there is a great deal of important evidence bearing <br>
on the crash that apparently has not been given the atten-<br>
tion that it deserves by either the official investigators <br>
or the news media. The most obvious and inexplicable example <br>
is the evidence provided by 183 eyewitnesses interviewed by <br>
the FBI who saw a streak of light heading toward the plane <br>
immediately before the explosion. According to an FBI report, <br>
96 of these eyewitnesses said they saw the streak of light <br>
rising from the surface.<br>
<p>
The disregard of the evidence provided by all these <br>
eyewitnesses raises a number of questions.<br>
<p>
 Why did the FBI insist that the NTSB not allow any eye-<br>
  witnesses to testify at its public hearing on the causes <br>
  of the crash?<br>
<p>
 Why did the Justice Department, through an assistant <br>
  U.S. attorney in New York City, order the investigative <br>
  team assembled by the NTSB not to undertake any eye-<br>
  witness interviews, but to leave that to the FBI?<br>
<p>
 Why did the FBI refuse to let the NTSB investigators <br>
  participate in its interviews of eyewitnesses?<br>
<p>
 Why has the FBI refused to release its eyewitness inter-<br>
  view reports to the press and public?<br>
<p>
 Why has the government tried to discredit eyewitness <br>
  testimony with the claim that all those people who said <br>
  they saw a rocket-like object rising from the surface and <br>
  exploding 14,000 feet up had really seen burning fuel <br>
  spilling from the fuel tanks in the plane's wings.<br>
<p>
The intelligent, sober people who saw a streak of light <br>
ascending shake their heads in disbelief when told that <br>
the government is saying that they really saw burning <br>
fuel falling.<br>
<p>
There are many more questions I would like to see answered. <br>
The investigators conducted tests to determine what impact <br>
a missile would have on the plane, what kind of "fingerprints" <br>
it would leave on the wreckage. But their testing raises <br>
these questions:<br>
<p>
 Why did they limit their testing of the impact of a <br>
  missile to small shoulder-fired missiles such as the <br>
  Stinger?<br>
<p>
 Don't they know that these small missiles would not <br>
  have been effective against a 747 flying at nearly <br>
  14,000 feet?<br>
<p>
 Why didn't they look for the clues that would be left <br>
  by the explosion of a large sophisticated missile <br>
  detonating in close proximity to the target?<br>
<p>
 Why did they ignore the compelling evidence that in-<br>
  dicates that this is just what happened?<br>
<p>
The public is entitled to an answer to those questions, but <br>
the mainstream media are not asking the questions. They have <br>
been content to accept the official explanation of the crash, <br>
disregarding all the evidence that casts doubt upon it.<br>
