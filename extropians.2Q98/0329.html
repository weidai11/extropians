<i>&gt; From: Reilly Jones &lt;Reilly@compuserve.com&gt;</i><br>
<p>
<i>&gt; otter@globalxs.nl wrote 4/11/98: &lt;Btw, suggestions for a better sounding</i><br>
<i>&gt; name are welcome; "Enlightened Rationalism" is too long and sounds too</i><br>
<i>&gt; pompous-a__ed.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A recap of the description you gave:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &lt;What it all boils down to is that any rational person... will use any</i><br>
<i>&gt; means that are available to him to reach his goals. Sometimes his actions</i><br>
<i>&gt; will benefit others, sometimes they will be neutral, and sometimes people</i><br>
<i>&gt; will get hurt.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No rationality is used in setting goals, only morality.  </i><br>
<p>
These two are in fact heavily intertwined, and it's allmost impossible<br>
to tell which came first and how they mutually influenced eachother.<br>
Morality itself is usually based on selfish hedonism: you (for ex.)<br>
help people because it "feels right", increases your self-asteem and<br>
you don't hurt people because that would you feel bad about yourself.<br>
Of course "feeling good" or "feeling bad" can also be dependent <br>
on what *others* think of you. So you're either pleasing yourself directly <br>
or pleasing the crowd (to please yourself). As time goes by another <br>
mechanism kicks in: the reluctance (fear/laziness) to change. Even if the <br>
old pattern of behaviour no longer gives the desired result, you keep it <br>
anyway out of habit. <br>
<p>
There are plenty of other elements when it comes to the moral memetic<br>
system, of course, but they all are more or less based on the punishment<br>
vs reward system, whether the subject realizes this or not. "Morals" and<br>
"ethics" are not some metaphysical, divine spark that's unique to (some)<br>
humans, but rather primitive impulse mixed with some logic.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;A rational person will recognize that most ethics and morals are nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; but artificial (extra) burdens on the way to ascension. Life is difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough as it is. Castigating yourself with piontless self-imposed rules and</i><br>
<i>&gt; regulations is pure S&amp;M.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Rational individuals do, in fact, use induction, they do not merely drift</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the waves of infantile desire.  They see that adherence to variations of</i><br>
<i>&gt; morals lead to variations of consequences, some good and some bad.  Some</i><br>
<i>&gt; morals are inductively superior to other morals, if the presupposition is</i><br>
<i>&gt; made that "life is good."  The ability to develop self-discipline is one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the key capacities that distinguishes homo sapiens from the amoeba.</i><br>
<p>
ER certainly encourages self-disciple, because it's very rational (useful).<br>
The idea that one has to have eleborate, inefficient morals based on<br>
a world view that's not in touch with reality in order to be "civilized" is<br>
downright silly. "Infantile desires" are the core of our being, instead of<br>
blindly suppressing them as you imply we should try to control their<br>
flow in such a way that we get the most out of life. By the way, your<br>
high morals are just another manifestation of primitive desires, the <br>
only difference is that they have been coated with some rhetoric fluff<br>
to make them look like something else.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;But, unlike many less user friendly philosophies Enlightened Rationalism</i><br>
<i>&gt; (TM)* does not forbid the use of force, including the use of force "just</i><br>
<i>&gt; for fun". It just says "keep an eye on the consequences", which is, wel...</i><br>
<i>&gt; rational. So if you feel like it, and think that you can get away with</i><br>
<i>&gt; it... by all means go ahead!&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Past adherents of E.R. would include Pol Pot, Attila the Hun, Mao Tse Tung,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan, V.I. Lenin...  A "nice" crowd,</i><br>
<i>&gt; all very successful, all very happy with their consequences, very rational.</i><br>
<p>
I saw this one coming from a mile away, that's why it said in the original <br>
message:<br>
<p>
"Ah, you might say, that would mean folks like Hitler, Stalin, the IRA and<br>
any damn street robber are enlightened. Not so. The other part of enlighten-<br>
ment is seeking technotranscendence (immortality, increased intelligence,<br>
physical strenght etc. through rational means like technology). To achieve <br>
this one needs a lot of foresight, which includes keeping a relatively low profile <br>
and (thus) minimizing the number of (potentially) dangerous enemies. Also, <br>
being nice can pay off in several ways, ranging from simply "a good feeling" to <br>
substantial material gain".<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; &lt;After all, most problems are caused by ridiculous, sanctimonious rules and</i><br>
<i>&gt; standards, and people not being able to live up to them an getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; frustrated because of it. Setting the morals too high only breeds</i><br>
<i>&gt; corruption, lies and blackmail, and sooner or later those who helped to</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetuate the system will be eaten by it themselves.&gt;</i><br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; Obviously, someone has offended you somewhere along the line by expecting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; standard of conduct from you that you couldn't live up to without</i><br>
<i>&gt; sacrificing your adolescent worship of the desire of the moment.  </i><br>
<p>
A touch of ad hominem? Actually, what I meant here is that making<br>
moral codes with lots of elaborate rules (like many religions do) will<br>
ultimately just backfire because hardly anyone can live up to all of<br>
them. Breaking rules will thus become an integral part of the moral<br>
memetic comlex, ultimately resulting in a neglect (open or secret)<br>
of *all* the rules/guidelines, including the useful ones. It is much<br>
more effective to reduce the number of rules (and dogmatism) to<br>
a bare minimum, and base them on common sense instead of ideas<br>
that fly in the face of human nature and logic. <br>
<p>
<i>&gt; The</i><br>
<i>&gt; record of history shows that corruption, lies and blackmail always result</i><br>
<i>&gt; from a lowering of moral standards, never from an elevating of them.  </i><br>
<p>
The real problems only start when all parties know (deep inside) that the<br>
rules are not sound, yet for the sake of "keeping up appearances" won't<br>
admit that to one another. The result is a hypocrite, two-faced society<br>
where problems aren't dealt with openly but are swept under the carpet. <br>
The "war on drugs" is a great example of this attitude.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is</i><br>
<i>&gt; irrational to ignore the historical record. </i><br>
<p>
Indeed.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Frustration over not being</i><br>
<i>&gt; able to live up to a high standard is adolescent, it is stereotypical of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the spoiled-child syndrome.  </i><br>
<p>
In some cases, yes. But often it is a result of the "high standard" being <br>
extremely human-unfriendly without any sound, logical reason, other<br>
than suppressing the population and teaching them "obedience". <br>
Although this may be useful and even necessary in some cases, <br>
overdoing it only makes life miserable for everyone involved.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; It is caused by an abrogation of parental</i><br>
<i>&gt; authority, i.e., decadent children come from corrupt parents.</i><br>
<p>
Many of the worst psychopaths come from families with strict (religious)<br>
rules, and the ones that don't crack up completely will carry the scars<br>
for life. Btw, this doesn't apply to me, I'm from a fairly liberal background.<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; &lt;For example, E.R. is neutral on the issues of increasing diversity and</i><br>
<i>&gt; being "life promoting".  These are matters of individual choice and depend</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the situation.&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If E.R. cannot bring itself to incorporate the metaphysical presupposition</i><br>
<i>&gt; that "life is good" then it is death-worship.  There is no neutrality on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this question, the default is always to entropy.</i><br>
<p>
E.R. firmly assumes that being alive is preferable to being dead. However,<br>
this does not force the individual who values his own life to act in a "life<br>
promoting" way towards *other* life forms. That's a *personal choice*, for<br>
which one must carry *personal responsibility*. In a complex world as<br>
ours a dogma like "must preserve all life" is not realistic/practical. It's<br>
as arbitrary as a dogma that says "must bark like a dog and hop on one<br>
foot every time I see a red car".<br>
 <br>
<i>&gt; In summary, it sounds like E.R. is merely license for a bunch of adolescent</i><br>
<i>&gt; Uzi-toting street-corner Übermensch out for a joy-ride using up the moral</i><br>
<i>&gt; capital stored up in previous generations by the prey around them.  </i><br>
<p>
Theoretically, you could be right. In reality (which seems painfully predictable<br>
at times) those kind of people don't give a damn about transhumanistic ideas,<br>
and thus aren't ERs. If they were they'd wait with this kind of behaviour until we<br>
have perfect VR, unless by "Ubermesch" you mean something akin to a Power.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggest, instead of "Enlightened Rationalism", the more honest "Sophomoric</i><br>
<i>&gt; Parasitism".</i><br>
<p>
Sophomoric parasites can be ERs, yes, just like they can be regular <br>
transhumanists, christians, communists etc, but it's hardly an appropriate<br>
name for my elegant theory, don't you think? ;-)<br>
