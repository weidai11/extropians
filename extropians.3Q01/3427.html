---------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p>The mainstream claims the tests detect specific antibodies to a virus,
<br>
and are therefore markers of an active infection.  Dissidents are of two
<br>
main schools, the Duesberg school says the virus is harmless, while the
<br>
Perth Group says the antibodies are produced by the body itself under
<br>
catabolic stress, and are, therefore, markers of undefined ill health.
<br>
In other words, the DNA of immune-system cells already in trouble
<br>
frequently start expressing proteins, the purpose of which isn't clear.
<br>
<p>IMHO, the Perth Group has a good argument, and I used to maintain a web
<br>
page summarizing their views at
<br>
<a href="http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/aids/aids.htm">http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/aids/aids.htm</a> which is still accessable.
<br>
<p>There has been a recent development which I think may be significant.
<br>
<p>According to Robert A. Giraldo, MD, who has been working for 6 years at
<br>
a laboratory of clinical immunology in one of the University Hospitals
<br>
in the City of New York, to run the ELIZA test for HIV surrogate markers
<br>
an individuals blood is diluted 1:400 with a special specimen dilutent.
<br>
This extraordinarily high dilution of the person.s serum [400 times]
<br>
took him by surprise. Most serologic tests that look for the presence of
<br>
antibodies against germs uses neat serum [undiluted]. For example, the
<br>
tests that look for antibodies to hepatitis A and B viruses, rubella
<br>
virus, syphilis, hystoplasma and cryptococus, to mention a few of them,
<br>
use straight serum [undiluted]. However, to try to prevent false
<br>
positive reactions some serologic tests use diluted serum; for example
<br>
this is the case with tests that look for antibodies to measles,
<br>
varicella and mumps viruses which use a dilution of 1:16, to
<br>
cytomegalovirus [CMV] 1:20 and to Epstein-Barr Virus [EBV] 1:10.
<br>
<p>The obvious questions are: What makes HIV so unique that the test serum
<br>
needs to be diluted 400 times? And what would happen if the individual.s
<br>
serum is not diluted ?
<br>
<p>To answer these questions he ran an experiment in a medical laboratory
<br>
in Yorktown Heights, New York, using the same test kit reagents that are
<br>
usually used to run the ELISA test in most clinical laboratories
<br>
worldwide.
<br>
<p>He first took samples of blood that, at 1:400 dilution, tested negative
<br>
for antibodies to HIV. He then ran the exact same serum samples through
<br>
the test again, but this time without diluting them. Tested straight,
<br>
they all came positive.
<br>
<p>Since that time he has run about 100 specimens and have always gotten
<br>
the same result. He ran his own blood which at 1:400 reacts negative. At
<br>
1:1 [undiluted] it reacted positive.
<br>
<p>He discusses three possible explanations for why undiluted specimens of
<br>
blood always react positive at the ELISA test:
<br>
<p>----------------------------------[begin quote]
<br>
[1] Everybody has HIV antibodies.
<br>
<p>It is accepted worldwide that the ELISA test for HIV detects antibodies
<br>
against what is known as the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (3-6). And the
<br>
pharmaceutical company that commercializes the ELISA kits states that
<br>
&quot;Abbott
<br>
HIVAB HIV-1 EIA is an in vitro qualitative Enzyme Immunoassay for the
<br>
Detection of Antibody to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) in
<br>
Human Serum and Plasma&quot; (1).
<br>
<p>Since all undiluted blood specimens react positive on the ELISA test, a
<br>
test that supposedly tests for antibodies to HIV, the results presented
<br>
here suggest that every single human being has HIV antibodies. And this
<br>
suggests that everybody has been exposed to HIV antigens.
<br>
<p>This would mean that all of us have been exposed to the virus that is
<br>
believed to be the cause of AIDS. The people that react positive even at
<br>
a dilution of 1:400, would be the ones that have had the highest level
<br>
of exposure to HIV antigens. The rest of the people - the ones that only
<br>
react positive with undiluted serum [1:1] - would have had a lower level
<br>
of exposure to HIV.
<br>
<p><p>[2] Everybody has different levels of HIV infection.
<br>
<p>It is also believed worldwide that a person that reacts positive for
<br>
antibodies against HIV has not only been exposed to but is infected with
<br>
a deadly virus that causes immunedeficiency (3-6). Therefore, the
<br>
positive reactions of all undiluted serums would mean that everybody, or
<br>
at least all the blood samples that I have tested, including my own, are
<br>
infected with this &quot;deadly&quot; virus. The ones that react positive at a
<br>
ratio of 1:400 would simply have a higher level of &quot;deadly&quot; infection
<br>
than the &quot;deadly&quot; infection had by the ones that only react positive
<br>
with undiluted serum.
<br>
<p><p>[3] The test is not specific for HIV.
<br>
<p>The results presented here could also mean that the tests used for
<br>
detecting antibodies to HIV are not specific for HIV, as has been
<br>
explained previously (7-14). In this case, there would be reasons other
<br>
than HIV infection, past or present, to explain why a person reacts
<br>
positive to it. The test also reacts positive in the absence of HIV
<br>
(7-14).
<br>
<p>The scientific literature has documented more than 70 different reasons
<br>
for getting a positive reaction other than past or present infection
<br>
with HIV (7,10,11,14,15). All these conditions have in common a history
<br>
of polyantigenic stimulations (15,16).
<br>
<p>Even Abbott Laboratories is well aware of the specificity problems with
<br>
the ELISA test. This is why they state: &quot;EIA testing alone cannot be
<br>
used to diagnose AIDS, even if the recommended investigation of reactive
<br>
specimens suggests a high probability that the antibody to HIV-1 is
<br>
present&quot; and &quot;Although for all clinical and public health applications
<br>
of the EIA both the degree of risk for HIV-1 infection of the person
<br>
studied and the degree of reactivity of the serum may be of value in
<br>
interpreting the test, these correlations are imperfect.
<br>
<p>Therefore, in most settings it is appropriate to investigate repeatably
<br>
reactive specimens by additional more specific or supplemental tests&quot;
<br>
(1). Interestingly, there are countries like Great Britain where the
<br>
diagnosis of HIV status is based on the ELISA test alone. No Western
<br>
blot or any other test is needed there.
<br>
<p>The only proper way for establishing the sensitivity and specificity of
<br>
a given test is with a gold standard. However, since HIV has never been
<br>
isolated as an independent purified viral entity (17-19), there cannot
<br>
be a gold standard for HIV. The sensitivity and specificity of the
<br>
antibody tests for HIV have instead been defined based on the assumption
<br>
that HIV is the cause of AIDS. In this way, &quot;The Abbott studies show
<br>
that: Sensitivity based on an assumed 100% prevalence of HIV-1 antibody
<br>
in AIDS patients is estimated to be 100% (144 patients tested)&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Specificity based on an assumed zero prevalence of HIV-1 in random
<br>
donors is estimated to be 99.9% (4777 random donors tested)&quot; (1).
<br>
<p>&quot;At present there is no recognized standard for establishing the
<br>
presence and absence of HIV-1 antibody in human blood. Therefore
<br>
sensitivity was computed based on the clinical diagnosis of AIDS and
<br>
specificity based on random donors&quot; (1).
<br>
<p>Since there is no scientific evidence that the ELISA test is specific
<br>
for HIV antibodies, a reactive ELISA test at any concentration of the
<br>
serum would mean presence of non-specific or polyspecific antibodies
<br>
(20). These antibodies could be present in all blood samples. They are
<br>
most likely a result of the stress response, having no relation to any
<br>
retrovirus, let alone HIV (21,22). In this case, a reactive test could
<br>
be a measure of the degree of one.s exposure to stressor or oxidizing
<br>
agents (15,16).
<br>
<p>The inevitable conclusion is that all positive reactions for antibodies
<br>
to HIV are simply false positives. If nobody is positive for HIV, then
<br>
people who react positive on the ELISA test do so due to something other
<br>
than HIV.
<br>
<p><p>Proposal to find out the real meaning of the &quot;HIV antibody&quot; tests
<br>
<p>To uncover the meaning of these tests I propose a simple experiment:
<br>
Take blood from three groups of people and run the tests highly diluted,
<br>
undiluted and at a wide spectrum of dilutions in between. The first
<br>
group would be a group of healthy people of many age groups; the second
<br>
group would be a group of people from the conventional AIDS &quot;risk
<br>
groups&quot;; the third group would be a group of people with clinical
<br>
conditions both related and unrelated to AIDS. All groups would be
<br>
subjected to both the ELISA and Western blot tests.
<br>
<p>Additionally, all blood samples could be subjected to the &quot;the viral
<br>
load test for  HIV&quot;. The results of such an experiment could determine
<br>
whether these test measurements bear any relationship to an individual.s
<br>
level of exposure to stressor or oxidizing agents. If so, the tests
<br>
could be salvaged as a measure of an individual.s level of intoxication.
