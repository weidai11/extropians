</em><br>
<p>I have made the decision to go for one hundred point zero zero percent
<br>
altruism and complete rationality.  The decision is not synonymous with
<br>
the achievement, but is a necessary precondition of that achievement.  To
<br>
make a deliberate compromise is to halt your progress at that point,
<br>
because even the best you can achieve and the most ambitious form of
<br>
sanity you can imagine is only another step on a long road where only the
<br>
next single step is visible at any given time.  There are a variety of
<br>
emotions that could act as sources of mental energy for my Singularity
<br>
work, the desire for fame among them.  The excuse is there if I choose to
<br>
use it.  I do not so choose.  I choose to relinquish those emotions rather
<br>
than compromise rationality.
<br>
<p>I made that choice at around age fifteen or sixteen, shortly after I
<br>
became aware of evolutionary psychology and the likelihood that the
<br>
emotions designed to underly altruism would not be consistent with the
<br>
declared goals of altruism.  Because emotions like the desire for fame are
<br>
fairly clear-cut - are &quot;exceptional conditions&quot; within the event-loop of
<br>
the mind - it is possible to learn to identify the emotion's subjective
<br>
feel, notice it, and disbelieve the mental imagery that causes it.  I've
<br>
since moved on to more interesting areas of mental cleanup.  As far as
<br>
things like the desire for fame go, I am finished.  If you were to
<br>
identify the brain-level hardware support for fameseeking and insert a
<br>
little alarm that went off whenever the brainware activated, I think the
<br>
activity level would be essentially zero; if the alarm ever went off, it
<br>
would be a small, choked cough as the emotion was triggered, I noticed the
<br>
subjective feel, and the emotion was subsequently wiped out of existence. 
<br>
(I am still validating my desire for routine social respect, which is
<br>
quite a different thing from a desire for general fame - although I am
<br>
recently starting to believe that this emotion may be &quot;considered harmful&quot;
<br>
as well.)
<br>
<p>In short, I'm now confident enough about my mental cleanup that I can talk
<br>
about it without making nervous little disclaimers such as &quot;But, of
<br>
course, who really knows what's inside their mind?&quot;  As far as the
<br>
specific cognitive force &quot;desire for fame&quot; is concerned, I predict that my
<br>
plans will exhibit no more sign of it than plans made by an AI.  I will
<br>
not make excuses in advance for failures because I am done cleaning up
<br>
that emotion and I do not expect there to be any failures.
<br>
<p>I realize that this is a claim for such an extraordinarily high level of
<br>
ability that Bayesian reasoners, reasoning from the prior expected
<br>
population levels of self-overestimators and extremely sane people, may
<br>
find that such a claim (considered as an unadorned abstract) is more
<br>
reason to doubt sanity than to believe it.  That's probably the reason why
<br>
a lot of people who are interested in the cognitive science of rationality
<br>
manage to sound self-deprecating when talking about it; not just as a
<br>
signal to others, I think, but as a signal to themselves, because they
<br>
*know* that high confidence in sanity is often a signal of insanity.  But
<br>
that in itself is unsanity.  It's saying, &quot;I observe that I'm damned good
<br>
at being sane, but I won't admit it even to myself, because if I sent
<br>
myself the signal of confidence in sanity, I might have to interpret that
<br>
signal as evidence of insanity.&quot;
<br>
<p>And yes, for some years, I gave myself the runaround this way.  It's an
<br>
emergent flaw in the way that the human mind processes pleasureable and
<br>
painful anticipations, and not a single emotion that can be identified and
<br>
dealt with.  I'm also sad to admit that my giving myself the runaround was
<br>
eventually crushed under the buildup of experience, rather than noticed
<br>
via pure abstract logic.  I only started working with the general problem
<br>
of pleasurable and painful anticipations while writing &quot;Creating Friendly
<br>
AI&quot;, and am actually still working on cleaning that general class of
<br>
emergent problems out of my own mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I never feel any the worse about someone when I come to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to think that either fame or fortune is a factor in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior.  The only thing that annoys me is when they're so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparent about it that it comes accross as petty and blind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and seems to bespeak an inability to see the situation from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others' points of view.
</em><br>
<p>Fame, as a motive to do good, is certainly preferable to the various
<br>
motives to do things that aren't good.  So, as noxious emotions go,
<br>
fameseeking is fairly far down on my list of emotions to target in
<br>
others.  The main reason for me to be concerned about observed fameseeking
<br>
is if I see it in someone who I think would like to be a rational
<br>
altruist, and who's already gotten fairly far in cleaning up the mental
<br>
landscape.  Even so, fameseeking acts as an approximation to rational
<br>
altruism under some circumstances, and I am thus willing to use this
<br>
emotion as memetic shorthand - provided that the arguments are truthful,
<br>
the flaws in the approximation to altruistic rationality are either unused
<br>
or explicitly dealt with, and pure rationality is closer than under the
<br>
previous status quo.  But there's no way that you could use the argument
<br>
from post-Singularity fame, because the underlying statement is probably
<br>
not truthful (do transhumans care?) and also because Singularitarians are
<br>
generally supposed to *be* conscious rationalists and the use of emotional
<br>
shorthand may lower the standard.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, it's acceptable to say:  &quot;You are one of only six
<br>
billion entities, in a galaxy of four hundred billion stars and decillions
<br>
of sentient beings, whose lives predate the Singularity; you are one of
<br>
the oldest of all living things.  I don't know whether you or anyone else
<br>
will respect that in the future, because it's difficult to predict what
<br>
transhumans will care about, but it does say something about how we should
<br>
feel *now*.  We are not just the six billion people who were around before
<br>
the Singularity; we are the six billion people who created the
<br>
Singularity.  An incomprehensibly huge future rests on the consequences of
<br>
our present-day actions, and 'the impact we have on the universe' is
<br>
essentially 'the impact we have on the Singularity'.&quot;
