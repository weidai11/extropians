Evolutionary Robotics: The Biology, Intelligence, and Technology of
<br>
Self-Organizing Machines. Stefano Nolfi and Dario Floreano. xii + 320 pp. The
<br>
MIT Press, 2000. $50.
<br>
<p>Just a few decades ago, scientists envisioned the &quot;house of tomorrow,&quot;
<br>
complete with robots that would assist us with daily chores, anticipate our
<br>
needs and learn from their mistakes. Yet none of us now live with such robot
<br>
companions.
<br>
<p>The primary reason for this failure lies in our historical approach to
<br>
designing and programming robots. The traditional approach attempts to
<br>
anticipate every possible required robotic behavior and write programs to
<br>
carry out specific routines that address those behaviors. This has proved to
<br>
be time-consuming, costly and ultimately unsuccessful. There are simply too
<br>
many unconsidered circumstances in any real-world robotics application. For
<br>
robots whose behavior relies on a rule-based architecture, extending the rules
<br>
to handle cases that were unforeseen or treated inappropriately has often
<br>
proved unwieldy. Some efforts have required orders-of-magnitude increases in
<br>
the number of rules to handle special cases, while generating little overall
<br>
improvement in performance.
<br>
<p>An alternative strategy for designing robots relies on inspiration from
<br>
nature, where evolution perfects carbon-based machines, which often carry out
<br>
complex goal-driven behaviors. Although the proposition for evolving robots
<br>
goes back at least to the mid 1950s, with George Friedman's master's thesis
<br>
from the University of California, Los Angeles, only recently have significant
<br>
efforts been made to apply nature's design principles to real robots-as
<br>
opposed to mere computer simulations of those machines. Stefano Nolfi and
<br>
Dario Floreano were two of the primary researchers working in this new area of
<br>
&quot;evolutionary robotics&quot; in the early 1990s, and they have continued to pursue
<br>
investigations of natural computing methods and robotics. Their new book
<br>
summarizes some of the important case studies in this growing field.
<br>
<p>Nolfi and Floreano offer basic introductory material regarding genetic
<br>
algorithms, a branch of evolutionary computation often used to optimize
<br>
robotic control architectures. These architectures often take the form of an
<br>
artificial neural network, a mathematical model based loosely on the way
<br>
biological neural networks are believed to operate. Artificial neural networks
<br>
possess many &quot;neurons,&quot; each of which acts as a mathematical transfer
<br>
function-that is, an input-output device. Each neuron transforms its incoming
<br>
activity signal into an output signal that is in turn passed along to other
<br>
neurons. Some neurons in the neural network may affect robotic controllers,
<br>
such as the rate of turning a single wheel on a Khepera robot. Other neurons
<br>
play the role of receptors-for example, reading in data from an infrared
<br>
sensor. Connections between the neurons in an artificial neural network are
<br>
weighted, and these weights, in large measure, dictate the overall behavior of
<br>
the robotic system. Evolutionary algorithms and other optimization techniques
<br>
are often used to search for appropriate weight sets, or even optimal neural
<br>
architectures.
<br>
<p>This book describes experiments (of increasing complexity, perhaps) in
<br>
different settings. To illustrate the basic approach, a small robot may be
<br>
placed in an arena (essentially a wooden racetrack measuring 80 by 50
<br>
centimeters) with the goal of having the robot learn to navigate the arena at
<br>
maximum speed without bumping into walls. The robot can perceive its
<br>
environment with eight infrared sensors that act either by measuring the
<br>
amount of ambient light or by emitting infrared light and measuring the amount
<br>
reflected. The robot executes a behavioral strategy represented by an
<br>
artificial neural network. In essence, alternative neural networks are
<br>
downloaded into the robot, which acts based on this programming. Some neural
<br>
networks are better than others at achieving the designer's goal. The best are
<br>
saved, and the worst are replaced by variations of the best; the analogy to
<br>
random variation and selection is obvious. Over time, a neural network emerges
<br>
that maximizes the robot's performance.
<br>
<p>This book goes into considerable detail, covering experiments with a variety
<br>
of robots, including some that walk rather than roll. In experiments using
<br>
coevolution, populations of robots compete against each other in predator-prey
<br>
situations, without human intervention. Nolfi and Floreano expect that the
<br>
evolutionary approach to robotics will lead to designs for robots that are
<br>
faster, more reliable and more robust than those fashioned with traditional
<br>
techniques.
<br>
<p>This book will be welcomed by those interested in building complex robots or
<br>
simple robots that do complex things. I have only two real criticisms. First,
<br>
much of the work cited isn't particularly recent. Many of the references
<br>
predate 1997; insufficient attention is paid to information about ongoing
<br>
efforts published in the most contemporary conference proceedings and
<br>
journals. In this rapidly emerging field, information about the most recent
<br>
efforts is particularly pertinent. Second, the book is not well copyedited. I
<br>
noted numerous agreement errors and misspellings, and at least one quotation
<br>
never closed. I found this quite distracting and below the standard of a major
<br>
scientific publisher, but I suspect that interested researchers easily will
<br>
look past the substandard presentation and benefit from the technical details

<p>Book Description
<br>
<p>Evolutionary robotics is a new technique for the automatic creation of
<br>
autonomous robots. Inspired by the Darwinian principle of selective
<br>
reproduction of the fittest, it views robots as autonomous artificial
<br>
organisms
<br>
that develop their own skills in close interaction with the environment and
<br>
without human intervention. Drawing heavily on biology and ethology, it uses
<br>
the tools of neural networks, genetic algorithms, dynamic systems, and
<br>
biomorphic engineering. The resulting robots share with simple biological
<br>
systems the characteristics of robustness, simplicity, small size,
<br>
flexibility,
<br>
and modularity.
<br>
<p>In evolutionary robotics, an initial population of artificial chromosomes,
<br>
each
<br>
encoding the control system of a robot, is randomly created and put into the
<br>
environment. Each robot is then free to act (move, look around, manipulate)
<br>
according to its genetically specified controller while its performance on
<br>
various tasks is automatically evaluated. The fittest robots then &quot;reproduce&quot;
<br>
by swapping parts of their genetic material with small random mutations. The
<br>
process is repeated until the &quot;birth&quot; of a robot that satisfies the
<br>
performance
<br>
criteria.
<br>
<p>This book describes the basic concepts and methodologies of evolutionary
<br>
robotics and the results achieved so far. An important feature is the clear
<br>
presentation of a set of empirical experiments of increasing complexity.
<br>
Software with a graphic interface, freely available on a Web page, will allow
<br>
the reader to replicate and vary (in simulation and on real robots) most of
<br>
the
<br>
experiments.
<br>
