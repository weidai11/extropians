Computers as saviors
<br>
Pioneer foresees technology creating `alien intelligence' to satisfy our needs

<br>
<p>In 1977, Elvis died, Gerald Ford left the White House and Bill Gates still
<br>
banged out business correspondence on a typewriter. Most Americans had never
<br>
seen a personal computer, much less a laptop.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, James Martin looked into the future and saw the Internet, as well
<br>
as computers in everyone's pockets.
<br>
<p>In his book, The Wired Society, he proclaimed that by the year 2000, computers
<br>
and other devices linked by fibre optics, telephone lines and radio waves
<br>
would allow millions of people to exchange electronic mail, shop for
<br>
merchandise, trade stocks, work at home, take classes, pay taxes, plan
<br>
vacations and entertain themselves. He added that entrepreneurs who jumped in
<br>
early would reap vast fortunes.
<br>
<p>Not bad.
<br>
<p>So when Martin makes a forecast, people listen. In a new book, After The
<br>
Internet: Alien Intelligence, he insists that we are on the cusp of a
<br>
discontinuous leap in what computers can do and that the changes coming,
<br>
properly guided, will lead us all to a land of milk and honey.
<br>
<p>``It's not just a question of computers becoming more powerful but rather of
<br>
their developing a different kind of intelligence,'' Martin says.
<br>
<p>``We will have machines that are a billion times more intelligent than we are,
<br>
but only in narrow, specific ways. In the 1960s and 1970s, the
<br>
artificial-intelligence people kept telling us that in 20 years computers
<br>
would be as intelligent as people. We cannot now get close to programming what
<br>
a mosquito does, much less a human being.''
<br>
<p>We must abandon the false promise of artificial intelligence - the general
<br>
term for technologies that aim to emulate human cognition - and understand,
<br>
embrace and exploit the alien nature of computer thinking, he says. There will
<br>
be close, synergistic partnerships with machines. Humans will undertake
<br>
creative tasks, leaving the drudgery of realizing them to evolved computers
<br>
that are simultaneously mysterious, powerful and oddly naive.
<br>
<p>Martin likens them to human idiot savants, and as such, he believes we can
<br>
keep them under control - ``a person with general intelligence will always
<br>
find ways to control a person without such intelligence.''
<br>
<p>Such predictions are backed up by credentials as imposing as Martin's
<br>
6-foot-5' frame. Now 67, he was the father of computer-aided systems
<br>
engineering (CASE), a fundamental breakthrough in the 1980s that automated
<br>
software development.
<br>
<p>Multinational CEOs and other corporate Brahmins still pay him up to $35,000
<br>
(U.S.) a day to tell them what the future will bring and apparently find it
<br>
money well spent.
<br>
<p>Martin has started a half-dozen wildly successful software and consulting
<br>
companies, including James Martin Associates, which brought Microsoft founder
<br>
Bill Gates to Bermuda in 1990 to try to buy it. (Martin declined, saying:
<br>
``The company was growing. I saw no point in selling.'')
<br>
<p>Bold, dead-on prognostication has made the reserved, soft-spoken Martin a
<br>
millionaire many times over, but he contends that accumulating wealth was
<br>
never his sole aim. Rather, he says, what he enjoys is imparting his latest
<br>
vision. He wants his clients, and the rest of us, to realize that ``human
<br>
history has been a story of desire outstripping the means to achieve it, but
<br>
that may well be reversing.''
<br>
<p>In an era when it is fashionable to fear the fast-changing, high-tech future,
<br>
Martin contends we should climb aboard and grasp the reins firmly.
<br>
<p>``We need to think hard about the new power we human beings have and make sure
<br>
we use it to our benefit,'' he says. ``We need to keep talking about these
<br>
changes. We need to become masters of complexity, and we need to do it rather
<br>
quickly.''
<br>
<p>What could a new wave of technology do? Imagine, Martin says, hardware and
<br>
software that vastly expand our ability to meet human desires. Imagine a
<br>
technological world that plumps pillows, smoothes paths, and cleans, greens
<br>
and beautifies in the precise ways that we want.
<br>
<p>For example, take the present hassle of proving you are who you say you are:
<br>
cards to access automatic teller machines, credit cards, driver's licences and
<br>
so on.
<br>
<p>Martin says your wallet will grow thin as programs like TrueFace recognize
<br>
your unique appearance. Doors will open, cars will start. Pay phones, vending
<br>
machines and parking metres will automatically bill you.
<br>
<p>Medicine will prevent illness rather than provide remedies after the fact.
<br>
Intelligent software will comb health and genetic data, foreseeing not only
<br>
the likelihood of, say, a heart attack but also prescribing therapies to keep
<br>
it from happening.
<br>
<p>As for the environment, Martin believes the whole planet could follow the path
<br>
of Agar's Island, his home in Bermuda. An abandoned British military munitions
<br>
storage site that he purchased in 1995, the island is becoming a tropical
<br>
fantasy.
<br>
<p>``It is a great example of how the planet's bad places can become very nice
<br>
places to be if technology is put to use intelligently,'' he says.
<br>
<p>The engine of this transformation will be what he terms alien intelligence -
<br>
computer smarts evolved so far beyond human thinking that they can do things
<br>
no conventionally programmed computer can, in ways no human being can
<br>
understand.
<br>
<p>Martin explains that computers are beginning to use Darwinian-like
<br>
evolutionary programs to ``breed'' solutions to problems - and unlike
<br>
biological evolution, the computers can spawn thousands of new generations per
<br>
second.
<br>
<p>By using genetic algorithms, programmers the world over are already
<br>
replicating evolution to tackle virtually every area of human enterprise, from
<br>
improving steel quality in European mills to maximizing production schedules
<br>
to more precisely aiming radiation therapy beams in British hospitals.
<br>
<p>Even hardware can evolve. The field-programmable gate array chip, invented in
<br>
the 1980s but just now reaching its potential, gives a glimpse of how future
<br>
computer circuits will design themselves.
<br>
<p>Unlike a typical silicon chip with etched immutable switches, or ``gates'' in
<br>
chip parlance, the field-programmable chip can be reconfigured instantly and
<br>
endlessly. Better yet, it can be bred rather than designed to do a task.
<br>
<p>Closely linked to the rise in evolutionary computation, Martin predicts, will
<br>
be an explosion in artificial neural networks: computer hardware and software
<br>
that link powerful parallel processors so that they roughly but narrowly
<br>
emulate the learning capacity of the human brain.
<br>
<p>Martin predicts that in as little as 10 years, what he calls breeding
<br>
factories - vast buildings as big as a General Motors assembly plant filled
<br>
with parallel-processing supercomputers - will dot the Earth.
<br>
<p>Such factories will breed software and field-programmable chips capable of
<br>
astounding feats, then spread their products worldwide via the Internet.
<br>
<p>One concern, voiced by Sun Microsystems' co-founder Bill Joy, is that if
<br>
computer intelligence continues to increase at a compounding rate, computers
<br>
will quickly render human beings useless, or even turn on them.
<br>
<p>Martin disagrees. Computer intelligence, he emphasizes, has always been so
<br>
different from human thought processes that it's wrong-headed to see the two
<br>
as locked in a race toward similar goals. Still, he concedes, ``we are going
<br>
to make mistakes.''
<br>
<p>A couple of 800-passenger jets colliding in mid-air due to faulty
<br>
alien-intelligence software is the sort of mischance that could make the
<br>
public ``go hysterical,'' Martin says.
<br>
<p>``While we will make mistakes, what most of the pessimists forget is that
<br>
human beings are not passive. Once things begin to go wrong, humans have great
<br>
skill at thinking up ingenious ways to correct the problem.''
<br>
<p>Martin smiles. ``I can think of no reason why we should stop doing that.''
