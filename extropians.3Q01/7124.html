<p>OSAMA BIN LADEN:
<br>
THE BALKAN CONNECTION
<br>
by Srdja Trifkovic
<br>
<p>So we are at war. Terrorism is the enemy, personified by Osama Bin Laden.
<br>
But before America commits its treasure and risks the lives of its young men
<br>
(&quot;and women&quot;) to this epic struggle, a few stables need to be cleaned and
<br>
some unpleasant skeletons removed from government cupboards.  Bill Gertz,
<br>
writing in today's (9/18) Washington Times, proves conclusively that Osama
<br>
bin Laden's terrorist network is thriving in Albania. [Read the article]
<br>
<p>It is not enough to bewail the fact that bin Laden's rise was facilitated by
<br>
the hefty support he received from the CIA in the 1980's. At that early
<br>
stage one could justify the policy--mistaken and shortsighted, as it turned
<br>
out to be--by the dictates of the Cold War: your enemy's enemy is your de
<br>
facto ally, if not a trusted friend. &quot;Blowback&quot; was a risk, but arguably
<br>
worth taking two decades ago. But if we are to take the war on terrorism
<br>
seriously today, it is also necessary:
<br>
<p>*To acknowledge that throughout the 1990s the Clinton Administration had
<br>
tolerated, and effectively aided and abetted bin Laden's operations in the
<br>
Balkans, long after he was recognized as a major security threat to the
<br>
United States;
<br>
<p>*To name the instigators of such policy in Washington, and to ensure that
<br>
none of them remain in any positions of responsibility as President Bush
<br>
plans his response to the recent outrage; and
<br>
<p>*To recognize that the Balkan policy of successive U.S. administrations--the
<br>
policy that had made this scandalous connection possible and, in a way,
<br>
inevitable--was fundamentally flawed, and requires urgent revision.
<br>
<p>BIN LADEN AND BOSNIA
<br>
<p>In the aftermath of America's &quot;Black September,&quot; it was confirmed in
<br>
Sarajevo that the Muslim authorities of Bosnia-Herzegovina had issued a
<br>
passport to Osama bin Laden at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna in 1993.  The
<br>
intention was obviously to facilitate the movements of a man who was fast
<br>
acquiring the reputation of a dangerous terrorist.
<br>
<p>That the government in Sarajevo was sympathetic to Islamic militants is
<br>
neither surprising nor remarkable, of course, but in this particular case
<br>
there was an old debt to be repaid.  Osama Bin Laden was an early supplier
<br>
of weapons to the Bosnian Muslims. His early efforts in 1992-93 were known
<br>
to the Clinton administration and quietly tolerated by it.  He was given a
<br>
free hand in the Balkans and eventually established a strong foothold in the
<br>
heart of Europe, initially under the guise of humanitarian work.
<br>
<p>The facts of the case were known to the media.  In the summer of 1996, the
<br>
Washington Post confirmed that &quot;the Clinton administration knew of the
<br>
activities of a so-called Relief Agency which was, in fact, funneling
<br>
weapons and money into Bosnia to prop up the Izetebegovic Muslim government
<br>
in Sarajevo.&quot;
<br>
<p>It was funneling troops, too.  The mujahideen had first come to Bosnia in
<br>
1992 and numbered over 3,000 by the summer of 1995.  They included
<br>
volunteers from the Middle East, as well as deserters from the Turkish,
<br>
Malaysian and French UNPROFOR units.  They never took prisoners: wounded
<br>
Serb soldiers were usually decapitated.
<br>
<p>Under the Dayton Peace Accords, all Islamic volunteers who fought with the
<br>
Muslim government army were supposed to leave the country. An undisclosed
<br>
number remained, however, having been given Bosnian citizenship and
<br>
permanent residence.  Several hundred had taken over what was the Serbian
<br>
village of Bocinja Donja, in central Bosnia, and provided instruction to
<br>
local Muslim forces in terrorist activities.
<br>
<p>They first attracted attention when on December 18, 1995--only a month after
<br>
Dayton--a car bomb prematurely exploded in the central Bosnian town of
<br>
Zenica.  It was apparently meant for American troops stationed nearby, as
<br>
revenge for the sentencing of Sheik Omah Abdel Rahman in connection with the
<br>
World Trade Center bombing.
<br>
<p>Two months later, in February 1996, SFOR units raided the training center of
<br>
the Bosnian government's secret police (AID), located near Fojnica. Several
<br>
persons were arrested for preparing terrorist actions. It transpired that
<br>
instructors from the Middle East were teaching AID officers how to disguise
<br>
bombs as toys and ice cream cones.
<br>
<p>Only months later the Bosnian Connection started making an impact abroad.
<br>
Reporting on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
<br>
the New York Times reported on June 26, 1997, that several suspects had
<br>
served with the Bosnian Muslim forces and were linked to Osama Bin Laden.
<br>
<em>&gt;From that point on the United States and its allies had complained
</em><br>
periodically and ineffectually to the Muslim authorities in Sarajevo about
<br>
the continued presence of the mujahadeen in Bosnia.
<br>
<p>By late 1999 this connection attracted further attention when U.S. law
<br>
enforcement authorities discovered that several suspects who have visited or
<br>
lived in Bosnia were associated with a terrorist plot to bomb targets in the
<br>
United States on New Year's Day.  Among them was Karim Said Atmani, who was
<br>
identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians
<br>
accused of plotting the bombings.  He is a former roommate of Ahmet Ressemi,
<br>
the man arrested at the Canadian-U.S. border in mid-December 1999 with a
<br>
carload of explosives.  Atmani has been a frequent visitor to Bosnia, even
<br>
after Ressmi's arrest.  Another Bosnian veteran, a Palestinian named Khalil
<br>
Deek, was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of
<br>
involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites; a second man with Bosnian
<br>
citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and
<br>
worked for a charity associated with Osama Bin Laden.  A third suspect, an
<br>
Algerian named Abu Mali, was regarded as a &quot;community leader&quot; in the Bosnian
<br>
village of Bocinja. Mehrez Amdouni, yet another former resident, was
<br>
arrested in September 1999 in Istanbul, where he arrived with a Bosnian
<br>
passport.  It has been confirmed that Ahmet Ressemi had ties with Said
<br>
Atmani, another terrorist who fought in the El Mujahadeen unit in
<br>
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Canadian authorities deported Atmani back to
<br>
Bosnia-Herzegovina on October 18, 1998, supposedly without knowing of his
<br>
alleged participation in terrorist activities through Europe.  The New York
<br>
Times Magazine reported on February 6, 2000 that &quot;last year, sources in
<br>
Jordan say, the Mukhabarat, the intelligence service, alerted the C.I.A. to
<br>
at least three plots by Bosnian-based Islamic terrorists to attack U.S.
<br>
targets in Europe.&quot;
<br>
<p>While an elaborate Islamic terror network was developing in Bosnia, Osama
<br>
bin Laden was busy looking for fresh opportunities in the Balkans. The
<br>
victims would remain the same; and yet again he could count on the quiet
<br>
complicity of the U.S. government.
<br>
<p>BIN LADEN AND KOSOVO: &quot;ADMINISTRATION FULLY AWARE&quot;
<br>
<p>During the NATO war against Serbia, in May 1999, U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe warned
<br>
that if American troops go into Kosovo they'd be fighting alongside a
<br>
terrorist organization known to finance its operations with drug
<br>
sales--including some to the United States. Inhofe was one of the few
<br>
legislators to note and complain that by joining hands with the KLA the
<br>
United States also would become partners of a sort with Osama bin Laden.
<br>
<p>Six months before the bombing, the Jerusalem Post reported that Bosnia was
<br>
the first bastion of Islamic power in the former Yugoslavia, but Kosovo
<br>
promised to be the second (&quot;Kosovo seen as new Islamic bastion&quot; by Steve
<br>
Rodan, September 14, 1998). The Albanians have been provided with financial
<br>
and military support from Islamic countries, the report went on, and they
<br>
were bolstered by hundreds of mujahadeen infiltrated from Albania. &quot;US
<br>
defense officials say the support includes that of Osama Bin Laden&quot; and the
<br>
Defense Department confirmed that bin Laden's Al Qa'ida organization
<br>
supported Moslem fighters in both Bosnia and Kosovo. The report quoted
<br>
sources in Washington as saying that the Clinton administration was fully
<br>
aware of the Islamic militants' activities in Bosnia and Kosovo, but had
<br>
looked the other way: &quot;The administration wants to keep the lid on the pot
<br>
at all costs . . . Needless to say, the Europeans have been quite upset by
<br>
this.&quot;
<br>
<p>The usually well-informed Israeli paper correctly sensed a shift in U.S.
<br>
policy that facilitated bin Laden's activities.  In early 1998, the State
<br>
Department had listed the KLA as an international terrorist organization
<br>
that supported itself with drug profits and through loans from known
<br>
terrorists like bin Laden.  By the end of that year the policy was reversed,
<br>
however.  On November 30, 1998, the Scotsman reported that the KLA &quot;had the
<br>
unusual honour of being taken off a register of organisations the US defines
<br>
as 'terrorists'. This is a valuable asset, not just in terms of public
<br>
relations. It also makes fund-raising among ethnic Albanians abroad much
<br>
easier.&quot;
<br>
<p>The KLA's rehabilitation in Washington went hand-in-hand with its growing
<br>
links with the Islamic radicals. The Sunday Times of London reported on
<br>
March 22, 1998, that Iranian Revolutionary Guards had joined forces with
<br>
Osama bin Laden to support the Albanian insurgency in Kosovo, hoping &quot;to
<br>
turn the region into their main base for Islamic armed activity in Europe.&quot;
<br>
By November the same paper confirmed that bin Laden's terrorist network in
<br>
Albania was regularly sending units to fight against the Serbs in Kosovo.
<br>
The paper pointed out that bin Laden's Albanian operation dated back to
<br>
1994, when its was established under the guise of a wealthy Saudi
<br>
humanitarian agency. In those early days bin Laden's group enjoyed the
<br>
support of then premier Sali Berisha--also an American &quot;asset&quot; at that
<br>
time--and the main KLA training base was subsequently established on
<br>
Berisha's property in northern Albania.
<br>
<p>Correctly sensing that the anti-Serb course of the Clinton administration
<br>
would lead it to tolerate his activities in Albania and Kosovo, bin Laden
<br>
issued a communiqué in August 1998 listing Serbia among &quot;the worst infidel
<br>
nations.&quot;  The communiqué, faxed to Knight Ridder from bin Laden's
<br>
supporters in London and translated from Arabic, boasted of &quot;great
<br>
victories&quot; in Bosnia and Kosovo.  By the end of 1998, as the United States
<br>
was building up its pressure on Belgrade to accept the Clinton
<br>
administration's terms on the beleaguered Serbian province, the Times of
<br>
London reported (November 26, 1998) that the Islamic fighters who &quot;created
<br>
havoc in the war in Bosnia&quot; were moving on to Kosovo.  The link between
<br>
Osama bin Laden and the KLA were facilitated by the chaotic conditions in
<br>
the neighboring Albania, the Times went on, allowing Muslim extremists to
<br>
settle there, often under the guise of humanitarian workers.
<br>
<p>&quot;They were terrorists in 1998 and now, because of politics, they're freedom
<br>
fighters,&quot; a top U.S. drug official complained to the Washington Times in
<br>
May 1999.  By that time the NATO bombing was in full swing, however, and the
<br>
mujahideen were once again American allies.  According to the Washington
<br>
Times, &quot;The reports said bin Laden's organization, known as al-Qaeda, has
<br>
both trained and financially supported the KLA.  Many border crossings into
<br>
Kosovo by 'foreign fighters' also have been documented and include veterans
<br>
of the militant group Islamic Jihad from Bosnia, Chechnya and Afghanistan.
<br>
Many of the crossings originated in neighboring Albania and, according to
<br>
the reports, included parties of up to 50 men.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bin Laden has become an integral attachment to each KLA operation.  It is
<br>
unsurprising, therefore, that he has established a presence in Macedonia,
<br>
the latest victim of the flawed U.S. policy.  The Washington Times wrote on
<br>
June 22 of this year that the NLA (the KLA subsidiary in Macedonia) was
<br>
largely--but not exclusively--dependent on the illegal trade in narcotics:
<br>
&quot;In addition to drug money, the NLA also has another prominent venture
<br>
capitalist: Osama bin Laden.&quot;  The sum supplied was estimated at between six
<br>
and seven million dollars over six months.
<br>
<p>In the aftermath of the tragedy in New York and Washington, it is certainly
<br>
desirable, and perhaps even possible, for the United States to devise an
<br>
effective anti-terrorist strategy.  This cannot be done, however, unless
<br>
there is a change of the policy that breeds terrorism. A decade of American
<br>
covert and overt support for the Muslims in the former Yugoslavia has been a
<br>
foreign policy disaster, detrimental to peace in the Balkans and to American
<br>
interests.  Its beneficiaries are Osama bin Laden and his co-religionists in
<br>
Sarajevo, Tirana, Pristina and Tetovo.  If we are to take the &quot;war on
<br>
terrorism&quot; seriously, the mistakes of the past need to be recognized and
<br>
rectified.
