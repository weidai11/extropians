The Internet is perceived as being everywhere, all at once. But geography
<br>
matters in the networked world, and now more than ever
<br>
<p>The Internet's new borders
<br>
<a href="http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_id=730089">http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_id=730089</a>
<br>
LONG, long ago in the history of the Internet-way back in February 1996-John
<br>
Perry Barlow, an Internet activist, published a &quot;Declaration of the
<br>
Independence of Cyberspace&quot;. It was a well-meaning stunt that captured the
<br>
spirit of the time, when great hopes were pinned on the emerging medium as a
<br>
force that would encourage freedom and democracy. &quot;Governments of the
<br>
industrial world,&quot; Mr Barlow declared, &quot;on behalf of the future, I ask you of
<br>
the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no
<br>
sovereignty where we gather. You have no moral right to rule us nor do you
<br>
possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear. Cyberspace
<br>
does not lie within your borders.&quot;
<br>
<p>Those were the days. At the time, it was widely believed that the Internet
<br>
would help undermine authoritarian regimes, reduce governments' abilities to
<br>
levy taxes, and circumvent all kinds of local regulation. The Internet was a
<br>
parallel universe of pure data, an exciting new frontier where a lawless
<br>
freedom prevailed. But it now seems that this was simply a glorious illusion.
<br>
For it turns out that governments do, in fact, have a great deal of
<br>
sovereignty over cyberspace. The Internet is often perceived as being
<br>
everywhere yet nowhere, as free-floating as a cloud-but in fact it is subject
<br>
to geography after all, and therefore to law.
<br>
<p>The idea that the Internet was impossible to regulate dates back to when its
<br>
architecture was far simpler than now. All sorts of new technologies have
<br>
since been bolted on to the network, to speed up the delivery of content,
<br>
protect networks from intruders, or target advertising depending on a user's
<br>
country or city of origin (see article). All of these technologies have
<br>
mundane commercial uses. But in some cases they have also provided governments
<br>
with ways to start bringing the Internet under the rule of local laws.
<br>
<p>The same firewall and filtering technology that is used to protect corporate
<br>
networks from intrusion is also, for example, used to isolate Internet users
<br>
in China from the rest of the network. A recent report on the Internet's
<br>
impact in China by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (CEIP), a
<br>
private think-tank based in Washington, DC, found that the government has been
<br>
able to limit political discourse online. Chinese citizens are encouraged to
<br>
get on the Internet, but access to overseas sites is strictly controlled, and
<br>
what users post online is closely monitored. The banned Falun Gong movement
<br>
has had its website shut down altogether. By firewalling the whole country,
<br>
China has been able to stifle the Internet's supposedly democratising
<br>
influence. &quot;The diffusion of the Internet does not necessarily spell the
<br>
demise of authoritarian rule,&quot; the CEIP report glumly concluded. Similarly,
<br>
Singapore and Saudi Arabia filter and censor Internet content, and South Korea
<br>
has banned access to gambling websites. In Iran, it is illegal for children to
<br>
use the Internet, and access-providers are required to prevent access to
<br>
immoral or anti-Iranian material. In these countries, local standards apply,
<br>
even on the Internet.
<br>
<p>To American cyber-libertarians, who had hoped that the Internet would spread
<br>
their free-speech gospel around the world, this is horrifying. Yahoo! is
<br>
appealing against the French decision, because it sets a precedent that would
<br>
require websites to filter their content to avoid breaking country-specific
<br>
laws. It would also have a chilling effect on free speech, since a page posted
<br>
online in one country might break the laws of another. Enforcing a judgment
<br>
against the original publisher might not be possible, but EU countries have
<br>
already agreed to enforce each other's laws under the Brussels Convention, and
<br>
there are moves afoot to extend this scheme to other countries too, at least
<br>
in the areas of civil and commercial law, under the auspices of the Hague
<br>
Convention.
<br>
<p>It is true that filtering and geolocation are not watertight, and can be
<br>
circumvented by skilled users. Filters and firewalls can be defeated by
<br>
dialling out to an overseas Internet access-provider; geolocation can be
<br>
fooled by accessing sites via another computer in another country. E-mail can
<br>
be encrypted. But while dedicated dissidents will be prepared to go to all
<br>
this trouble, many Internet users are unable to change their browsers' home
<br>
pages, let alone resort to these sorts of measures. So it seems unlikely that
<br>
the libertarian ethos of the Internet will trickle very far down in countries
<br>
with authoritarian regimes. The upshot is that local laws are already being
<br>
applied on the Internet. Old-style geographical borders are proving
<br>
surprisingly resilient.
<br>
<p>Getting real
<br>
In some ways this is a shame, in others not. It is certainly a pity that the
<br>
Internet has not turned out to be quite the force for freedom that it once
<br>
promised to be. But in many ways, the imposition of local rules may be better
<br>
than the alternatives: no regulation at all, or a single set of rules for the
<br>
whole world. A complete lack of regulation gives a free hand to cheats and
<br>
criminals, and expecting countries with different cultural values to agree
<br>
upon even a set of lowest-common-denominator rules is unrealistic. In some
<br>
areas, maybe, such as extradition and consumer protection, some countries or
<br>
groups of countries may be able to agree on common rules. But more
<br>
controversial matters such as free speech, pornography and gambling are best
<br>
regulated locally, even if that means some countries imposing laws that
<br>
cyber-libertarians object to.
<br>
<p>Figuring out whose laws apply will not always be easy, and thrashing all of
<br>
this out will take years. But it will be reassuring for consumers and
<br>
businesses alike to know that online transactions are governed and protected
<br>
by laws. The likely outcome is that, like shipping and aviation, the Internet
<br>
will be subject to a patchwork of overlapping regulations, with local laws
<br>
that respect local sensibilities, supplemented by higher-level rules governing
<br>
cross-border transactions and international standards. In that respect, the
<br>
rules governing the Internet will end up like those governing the physical
<br>
world. That was only to be expected. Though it is inspiring to think of the
<br>
Internet as a placeless datasphere, the Internet is part of the real world.
<br>
Like all frontiers, it was wild for a while, but policemen always show up
<br>
eventually.
<br>
<p>Putting it in its place
<br>
Aug 9th 2001
<br>
<em>&gt;From The Economist print edition
</em><br>
<p>BREWSTER KAHLE unlocks the cellar door of a wooden building in San Francisco's
<br>
Presidio Park. He steps inside, turns on the fluorescent lights to reveal a
<br>
solid black wall of humming computers, and throws out his arm theatrically.
<br>
&quot;This&quot;, he says, &quot;is the web.&quot; It is a seductive idea, but the web isn't
<br>
really housed in a single San Francisco basement. Mr Kahle's racks of
<br>
computers merely store archived copies of many of its pages which Alexa, his
<br>
company, analyses to spot trends in usage. The real Internet, in contrast, is
<br>
widely perceived as being everywhere, yet nowhere in particular. It is often
<br>
likened to a cloud.
<br>
<p>This perception has prompted much talk of the Internet's ability to cross
<br>
borders, break down barriers and destroy distance. On the face of it, the
<br>
Internet appears to make geography obsolete. But the reality is rather more
<br>
complicated. If you want a high-speed digital-subscriber line (DSL)
<br>
connection, for example, geographical proximity to a telephone exchange is
<br>
vital, because DSL only works over relatively short distances. Similarly, go
<br>
to retrieve a large software update from an online file library, and you will
<br>
probably be presented with a choice of countries from which to download it;
<br>
choosing a nearby country will usually result in a faster transfer. And while
<br>
running an e-business from a mountain-top sounds great, it is impractical
<br>
without a fast connection or a reliable source of electricity. The supposedly
<br>
seamless Internet is, in other words, constrained by the realities of
<br>
geography. According to Martin Dodge of University College London, who is an
<br>
expert on Internet geography, &quot;the idea that the Internet liberates you from
<br>
geography is a myth&quot;.
<br>
<p>What's more, just as there are situations where the Internet's physical
<br>
geography is all too visible when it ought to be invisible, the opposite is
<br>
also true. There is growing demand for the ability to determine the
<br>
geographical locations of individual Internet users, in order to enforce the
<br>
laws of a particular jurisdiction, target advertising, or ensure that a
<br>
website pops up in the right language. These two separate challenges have
<br>
spawned the development of clever tricks to obscure the physical location of
<br>
data, and to determine the physical location of users-neither of which would
<br>
be needed if the Internet truly meant the end of the tyranny of geography.
<br>
<p>Down on the farm
<br>
To see just how little the Internet resembles a cloud, it is worth taking a
<br>
look at where the Internet actually is. The answer, in short, is in cities.
<br>
This is partly a historical accident, says Anthony Townsend, an urban planner
<br>
at the Taub Urban Research Centre at New York University. He points out that
<br>
the Internet's fibre-optic cables often piggyback on old infrastructure where
<br>
a right-of-way has already been established: they are laid alongside railways
<br>
and roads, or inside sewers. (Engineers installing fibre-optic cables in a New
<br>
York building recently unearthed a set of pneumatic tubes, along which
<br>
telegrams and mail used to be sent in the 19th century.) Building the Internet
<br>
on top of existing infrastructure in this way merely reinforces real-world
<br>
geography. Just as cities are often railway and shipping hubs, they are also
<br>
the logical places to put network hubs and servers, the powerful computers
<br>
that store and distribute data.
<br>
<p>This has led to the rise of &quot;server farms&quot;, also known as data centres or web
<br>
hotels-vast warehouses that provide floorspace, power and network connectivity
<br>
for large numbers of computers, and which are located predominantly in urban
<br>
areas. A typical example can be found in Santa Clara, just off California's
<br>
Highway 101. It is run by Exodus Communications, a web-hosting firm which has
<br>
nine server farms in Silicon Valley and another 35 around the world. From the
<br>
outside, the farm is a deliberately nondescript building. A sophisticated
<br>
security system, with hand scanners and video cameras, keeps out unauthorised
<br>
visitors. Inside, the building resembles a jail, rather than a farm: it is
<br>
packed with row upon row of computers in locked metal cages, their fans
<br>
whirring and lights flashing. The air is filled with the deafening hum of
<br>
air-conditioning. There are no windows and few people, and the lights are
<br>
triggered by motion sensors, keeping unvisited parts of the farm in darkness.
<br>
Exodus's customers house their computers inside the metal cages, which are
<br>
supplied with power and network connections. Most of the world's biggest
<br>
websites live in buildings like this; Exodus hosts 49 of the top 100.
<br>
<p>As if to emphasise how physical constraints apply even to virtual spaces,
<br>
server farms are still rented by the good old-fashioned square foot. According
<br>
to figures published in April by Salomon Smith Barney, worldwide server-farm
<br>
capacity is growing by 50% annually, and will reach 22m square feet by the end
<br>
of 2001, despite the demise of the dotcoms. Cage space turns out to have other
<br>
uses, too: boastful corporate logos hang from many cages, and some firms have
<br>
posted job advertisements in the hope of poaching technical staff from rivals.
<br>
<p>The signs are that the storage of information is going to become even more
<br>
physically concentrated. One reason is the growth of &quot;managed hosting&quot; where,
<br>
instead of renting space on a farm for their own servers, firms rent the
<br>
computing capacity along with the power and network connectivity. In short,
<br>
they simply hand over their data, and leave running the servers to the hosting
<br>
company. As a result, there is no longer any need for customers to visit
<br>
farms, so they need not be located in metropolitan areas, where space is
<br>
limited and expensive. They can be anywhere, provided enough power and
<br>
bandwidth are available.
<br>
<p>In practice the constraint is power. A single server farm can consume as much
<br>
power as a small airport, or four large hospitals. As a result, says Jon
<br>
Feiber of Mohr Davidow Ventures, a venture-capital firm, the logical thing to
<br>
do is to build out-of-town server farms with their own power stations. Such
<br>
farms, he suggests, could be very large indeed: perhaps a dozen would be
<br>
enough for the whole of the United States. Just such a facility, with a 24MW
<br>
gas-fired power station, is being built just outside London by iXguardian, a
<br>
British computer-services firm. It will be the largest server farm in Europe.
<br>
<p>The combination of managed hosting and dedicated power stations means that
<br>
data will be increasingly concentrated in large farms. The rise of wireless
<br>
devices will drive this trend too: instead of storing data internally, such
<br>
devices will store information on the network and access it when needed. But
<br>
users wishing to access their data will still be spread out around the world.
<br>
So centralisation will drive demand for technology that can smooth out the
<br>
Internet's geographical lumpiness and speed the delivery of data; in short,
<br>
technology to obscure the physical location of Internet content from its
<br>
users.
<br>
<p>First, hide the data
<br>
One way to do this is to store copies of popular lumps of content in data
<br>
caches sprinkled around the world. The leader in this field, with over 11,000
<br>
caching servers in 62 countries, is Akamai, a firm based in Cambridge,
<br>
Massachusetts. The geographical distribution of Akamai's infrastructure is
<br>
strikingly different from that of Exodus. Broadly speaking, Akamai needs
<br>
servers near the consumers of content, whereas Exodus puts its farms near the
<br>
suppliers of content. Accordingly, Exodus has farms in North America, Europe,
<br>
Australia and Japan, but not in Africa or South America. Akamai, on the other
<br>
hand, has servers pretty much everywhere.
<br>
<p>Akamai's customers, which include CNN and Yahoo!, are content providers who
<br>
are prepared to pay to ensure that users around the world are able to access
<br>
their sites smoothly and quickly. Normally, when you visit a web server, a
<br>
description of the page you have requested is delivered across the network.
<br>
This consists of the page's text, plus references to any graphics (or sound or
<br>
film clips) associated with it. These items are then requested by your web
<br>
browser and delivered across the network. Finally, the browser assembles all
<br>
the components and displays the page. The problem is that while the text can
<br>
be delivered quickly, the &quot;heavy&quot; items (such as graphics and video) are much
<br>
larger and take longer to arrive. It is these items which Akamai can help to
<br>
deliver more quickly.
<br>
<p>It works like this. You request a web page in the usual way, and the page
<br>
description is delivered. But the references to the page's &quot;heavy&quot; items are
<br>
modified to fool your web browser into requesting those items from Akamai,
<br>
rather than from the original web server. Taking account of your location on
<br>
the network, and given the prevailing traffic conditions, Akamai then delivers
<br>
the heavy items from the nearest available cache, and the page pops up much
<br>
more quickly. By monitoring the demand for each item, and making more copies
<br>
available in its caches when demand rises, and fewer when demand falls,
<br>
Akamai's network can help to smooth out huge fluctuations in traffic. A
<br>
further benefit is that the customer's web server does not have to deliver the
<br>
heavy items, which reduces the load on it dramatically and makes it less
<br>
likely to collapse when faced with a sudden surge of visitors.
<br>
<p>A number of firms have followed in Akamai's footsteps by moving content to the
<br>
&quot;edges&quot; of the Internet. But there are several other ways to speed up content
<br>
delivery. One alternative approach is being taken by the Content Bridge
<br>
Alliance, a group led by a California software firm called Inktomi, whose
<br>
other members include AOL and Exodus. Rather than setting up a network of
<br>
thousands of caches, as Akamai has done, the Content Bridge Alliance's plan is
<br>
to connect existing networks and farms together more efficiently in order to
<br>
speed the flow of traffic. Yet another approach is being taken by Kontiki, a
<br>
firm launched this week by veterans of Netscape. It is one of several
<br>
start-ups that plan to combine Akamai's approach with that of Napster, the
<br>
infamous music-swapping service. Essentially, users' own computers will be
<br>
used as caches, so that recently accessed content can be delivered quickly
<br>
when needed to other users nearby on the network.
<br>
<p>Now, find the users
<br>
In parallel with all this effort to obscure the physical location of data on
<br>
the Internet, there is growing interest in determining the location of its
<br>
users. Laws and tax regimes are based on geography, not network topology;
<br>
online merchants, for example, may be allowed to sell some products in some
<br>
countries but not others. The growth in interest in &quot;geolocation&quot; services,
<br>
which attempt to pinpoint Internet users' locations based on their network
<br>
addresses, also signals the realisation that traditional marketing techniques,
<br>
based on geography, can be applied online too. Marie Alexander of Quova, a
<br>
Silicon Valley geolocation firm, points out that goods and services exist in
<br>
physical locations, and marketing is traditionally done on a geographical
<br>
basis. Rather than messing around with fiddly (and privacy-invading)
<br>
one-to-one marketing, she says, many firms are instead sticking with the old
<br>
geographical approach, but taking it online. Thus different visitors to a
<br>
website may be offered different products or special offers, depending on what
<br>
is available nearby.
<br>
<p>Quova's geolocation service, called GeoPoint, is based on a continually
<br>
updated database that links Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to countries,
<br>
cities and even postcodes. If you visit a website that is equipped with
<br>
GeoPoint software, your IP address is relayed to Quova's servers, which look
<br>
up your geographical location. This information is then used by the website to
<br>
modify the page's content based on your physical location. Quova claims to be
<br>
able to identify web users' country of origin with 98% accuracy, and their
<br>
city of origin (at least for users in the United States) 85% of the time.
<br>
Other firms, including Akamai, Digital Envoy, InfoSplit and NetGeo, offer
<br>
similar services.
<br>
<p>Once the user's location is known, existing demographic databases, which have
<br>
been honed over the years to reveal what kinds of people live where, can be
<br>
brought into play. But although targeted advertising is the most obvious
<br>
application for geolocation, it has many other uses. It can, for example, be
<br>
used to determine the right language in which to present a multilingual
<br>
website. E-commerce vendors and auction houses can use geolocation to prevent
<br>
the sale of goods that are illegal in certain countries; online casinos can
<br>
prevent users from countries where online gambling has been outlawed from
<br>
gaining access; rights-management policies for music or video broadcasts,
<br>
which tend to be based on geographical territories, can also be enforced. The
<br>
pharmaceutical and financial-services industries, says Ms Alexander, which are
<br>
subject to strict national regulation, can be confident that by offering goods
<br>
and services for sale online they are staying within the law. Borders, she
<br>
notes, are returning to the Internet.
<br>
<p>Interest in geolocation soared after last November's ruling by a French judge
<br>
requiring Yahoo!, an Internet portal, to ban the auction and sale of Nazi
<br>
memorabilia over the Internet to users in France. The ruling was significant
<br>
because it covered sales to French users even from Yahoo!'s websites located
<br>
in other countries. The implication is that to avoid breaking French law,
<br>
websites around the world where such items are sold must prevent French users
<br>
from gaining access-and geolocation technology allows them to do just that. Of
<br>
course, the technology is far from perfect; a panel of experts, including
<br>
Vinton Cerf, the networking guru who is known as the &quot;father of the Internet&quot;,
<br>
advised the judge that determining an individual user's country of origin was
<br>
unlikely to be possible more than 90% of the time. But all borders are
<br>
slightly porous, and the French judge decided that 90% was good enough.
<br>
<p>Rather than adopt geolocation technology, Yahoo! responded by banning the
<br>
auction of Nazi items across all of its sites, and says it has no plans to
<br>
reinstate them. But it is challenging the ruling in order to avoid having
<br>
other such restrictions placed on its content by other jurisdictions. The
<br>
company, which is based in America, has asked a federal court in San Jose to
<br>
declare the French ruling unenforceable in the United States. (Ironically,
<br>
Yahoo! said last month that it would begin using Akamai's geolocation
<br>
technology to target advertising and other content.)
<br>
<p>Critics of the French ruling agree that it would set a dangerous precedent, by
<br>
allowing one country to interfere with freedom of speech across the entire
<br>
Internet. &quot;If every jurisdiction in the world insisted on some form of
<br>
filtering for its particular geographic territory, the web would stop
<br>
functioning,&quot; Mr Cerf declared. Stanton McCandlish of the Electronic Frontier
<br>
Foundation, a pressure group, says he expects other governments to adopt
<br>
geolocation and other similar techniques to balkanise the Internet in coming
<br>
years. But he notes that geolocation is merely the latest example in a growing
<br>
trend to impose local controls on the Internet. China, for example, already
<br>
filters all Internet traffic flowing into and out of the country in order to
<br>
prevent its citizens from accessing particular websites.
<br>
<p>At the same time, the French ruling is regarded in some quarters as a logical
<br>
and pragmatic way forward for Internet regulation; in the real world, after
<br>
all, multinational firms are used to operating under different laws in
<br>
different countries. According to Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor,
<br>
&quot;the notion that governments can't regulate hangs upon a particular
<br>
architecture of the Net.&quot; As the Internet's architecture changes and becomes
<br>
more complex, with the addition of services like filtering and geolocation,
<br>
the idea that the Internet is beyond the reach of local laws and government
<br>
regulation looks less and less tenable.
<br>
<p>The revenge of geography
<br>
So much for the death of geography. And determining the location of Internet
<br>
users seems likely to become even more commonplace, and even more accurate,
<br>
with the rise of wireless Internet devices such as smart phones. Already, the
<br>
first &quot;location-based services&quot; have been launched, capable of sending text
<br>
messages to mobile-phone users in particular network cells. More accurate
<br>
positioning will be possible in future using a number of other techniques,
<br>
such as the satellite-based Global Positioning System. Advertisers are rubbing
<br>
their hands at the prospect of being able to send precisely targeted offers to
<br>
people near particular shops, or inside a sports arena, though privacy
<br>
concerns may yet scupper their plans. Less annoyingly, users of smart phones
<br>
may choose to call up location-specific information, such as maps or traffic
<br>
updates, or to locate a nearby restaurant. According to a recent estimate from
<br>
Analysys, a telecoms consultancy, global revenues from location-based services
<br>
will reach $18 billion by 2006-a figure that is regarded as conservative by
<br>
many in the industry.
<br>
<p>Mr Townsend notes that cities are, in a sense, vast information storage and
<br>
retrieval systems, in which different districts and neighbourhoods are
<br>
organised by activity or social group. A mobile Internet device, he suggests,
<br>
will thus become a convenient way to probe local information and services.
<br>
Location will, in effect, be used as a search parameter, to narrow down the
<br>
information presented to the user. Mobile devices, he says, &quot;reassert
<br>
geography on the Internet.&quot;
<br>
<p>At the moment, Internet users navigate a largely placeless datasphere. But in
<br>
future they will want location-specific information and access to their
<br>
personal data, wherever they are-and wherever it is. This will be tricky to
<br>
pull off, and impossible without taking geography explicitly into account. It
<br>
is undoubtedly true that the Internet means that the distance between two
<br>
points on the network is no longer terribly important. But where those points
<br>
are still matters very much. Distance is dying; but geography, it seems, is
<br>
still alive and kicking.
