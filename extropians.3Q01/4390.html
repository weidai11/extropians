<p><p>Censorship in action:
<br>
why I don't publish my HDCP results
<br>
<p>Niels Ferguson
<br>
August 15, 2001
<br>
<p>Summary
<br>
<p>I have written a paper detailing security weaknesses in the HDCP content
<br>
protection system. I have decided to censor myself and not publish this
<br>
paper for fear of prosecution and/or liability under the US DMCA law.
<br>
<p>Introduction
<br>
<p>My name is Niels Ferguson. I'm a professional cryptographer. My job is to
<br>
design, analyse, and attack cryptographic security systems, a bit like a
<br>
digital locksmith. I work to make computer systems and the Internet more
<br>
secure. You would think that people would be in favour of that, right?
<br>
<p>Computer security and cryptography are hard. It is easy to make mistakes,
<br>
and one mistake is all it takes to create a weakness. You learn from your
<br>
mistakes, but there are too many mistakes to make them all yourself. That's
<br>
why we publish. We share our knowledge with others, so that they don't have
<br>
to repeat the same mistake. Take a look at
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.macfergus.com/niels/dmca/index.html../pubs/publist.html">http://www.macfergus.com/niels/dmca/index.html../pubs/publist.html</a>&gt;my
<br>
publications. You will see a mixture of new designs, analyses, and attacks.
<br>
This is how we learn and how we improve the state of the art in computer
<br>
security.
<br>
<p>HDCP
<br>
<p>Recently I found the documentation of the
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.digital-cp.com">http://www.digital-cp.com</a>&gt;High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP)
<br>
system on the internet. HDCP is a cryptographic system developed by Intel
<br>
that encrypts video on the DVI bus. The DVI bus is used to connect digital
<br>
video cameras and DVD players with digital TVs, etc. The aim of HDCP is to
<br>
prevent illegal copying of video contents by encrypting the signal.
<br>
<p>HDCP is fatally flawed. My results show that an experienced IT person can
<br>
recover the HDCP master key in about 2 weeks using four computers and 50
<br>
HDCP displays. Once you know the master key, you can decrypt any movie,
<br>
impersonate any HDCP device, and even create new HDCP devices that will
<br>
work with the 'official' ones. This is really, really bad news for a
<br>
security system. If this master key is ever published, HDCP will provide no
<br>
protection whatsoever. The flaws in HDCP are not hard to find. As I like to
<br>
say: &quot;I was just reading it and it broke.&quot;
<br>
<p>What do you do when you find a result like this? First, you have to write
<br>
it down and explain it. Then you publish your paper so that the mistakes
<br>
can be fixed, and others can learn from it. That is how all science works.
<br>
I wrote a paper on HDCP, but I cannot publish it.
<br>
<p>DMCA
<br>
<p>There is a US law called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), that
<br>
makes it illegal to distribute &quot;circumvention technology&quot;, such as systems
<br>
that break copyright protection schemes. HDCP is used to protect
<br>
copyrights. There are lawyers who claim that a scientific paper like mine
<br>
is a circumvention technology within the meaning of the DMCA, because it
<br>
explains the weaknesses of a system. I have been advised by a US lawyer who
<br>
works in this field that if I publish my paper, I might very well be
<br>
prosecuted and/or sued under US law.
<br>
<p>This is outrageous.
<br>
<p>The risk to me
<br>
<p>I travel to the US regularly, both for professional and for personal
<br>
reasons. I simply cannot afford to be sued or prosecuted in the US. I would
<br>
go bankrupt just paying for my lawyers.
<br>
<p>I want to make it quite clear that Intel, who developed the HDCP system,
<br>
has not threatened me in any way. But the threat does not come only from
<br>
Intel. The US Department of Justice could prosecute me. Any other affected
<br>
party, such as a movie studio whose films are protected with HDCP, could
<br>
sue me under the DMCA. That is a risk I cannot afford to take.
<br>
<p>The simple alternative would be to never travel to the US again. This would
<br>
harm me significantly, both professionally and personally. It would lock me
<br>
out of many conferences in my field, and keep me away from family and friends.
<br>
<p>It all sounds a bit too far-fetched, right? Who would sue over the
<br>
publication of an article? Well, there are very good reasons to believe
<br>
that I risk a lawsuit if I publish my paper. A team of researchers led by
<br>
Professor Edward Felten was recently threatened with a DMCA-based lawsuit
<br>
if they published their own scientific article. The resulting court case is
<br>
still pending.
<br>
<p>Freedom of speech
<br>
<p>We have this little principle called the freedom of speech. It is codified
<br>
in the &lt;<a href="http://www.hrweb.org/legal/udhr.html">http://www.hrweb.org/legal/udhr.html</a>&gt;Universal Declaration of Human
<br>
Rights, the &lt;<a href="http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDERAL/usconst.html">http://www.law.emory.edu/FEDERAL/usconst.html</a>&gt;US Constitution,
<br>
and Dutch law. The whole point of freedom of speech is to allow the free
<br>
circulation of ideas and to let the truth be heard. There can be no doubt
<br>
that my paper is protected by the free speech rights.
<br>
<p>The DMCA imposes a serious restriction on the freedom of speech. The DMCA
<br>
makes it illegal to talk about certain security systems. The equivalent law
<br>
for non-digital protection systems would make it illegal to warn people
<br>
about a cheap and very weak door lock being installed on their houses
<br>
because criminals could also use that same information.
<br>
<p>In western society we restrict the freedom of speech only for very serious
<br>
reasons, and after careful consideration. For example, it is illegal to
<br>
shout &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theatre, or to ask someone to commit a murder.
<br>
The DMCA restricts the freedom of speech because the movie industry is
<br>
afraid of losing money. Below I will argue that the DMCA does not achieve
<br>
that goal, but that aside: do we really want to sell our freedom of speech
<br>
for money?
<br>
<p>The DMCA is a scary development. Next time that commercial interests clash
<br>
with the freedom of speech, the industry will point to the DMCA and claim
<br>
they need equivalent protection. They might outlaw the publication of a
<br>
report detailing bad safety features in a car, or of flaws found in a
<br>
particular brand of tires. After all, those publications harm industry too.
<br>
Where will it stop?
<br>
<p>Jurisdiction
<br>
<p>The DMCA is a US law. I am a citizen of the Netherlands, and I live and
<br>
work in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Why do I care about the DMCA at all?
<br>
<p>The USA is apt to apply its own laws way beyond its own borders. Dmitry
<br>
Sklyarov, a Russian programmer, was arrested last month in the US. He is
<br>
charged with violating the DMCA while performing his work in Russia as an
<br>
employee for a Russian firm. As far as we know, what he did was perfectly
<br>
legal in Russia, and in most other countries in the world. He is now out on
<br>
bail, but cannot leave northern California until further notice.
<br>
<p>Where does this lead to? What if countries start applying their own laws to
<br>
the things people do in other countries? Will you be arrested next time you
<br>
go abroad? Do you really want to take that holiday in China if you have
<br>
more than one child? Are you sure that Germany allows you to have those
<br>
links to political pamphlets on your web site? This type of
<br>
extraterritorial application of national law violates a basic human right,
<br>
because you cannot possibly know which laws apply to you. Imagine living in
<br>
a country where the laws are kept secret, and you never know whether you
<br>
are violating a law.
<br>
<p>Suppose a US citizen works for a firearms manufacturer in the US, making
<br>
guns. One of those guns turns up here in Amsterdam and is used to commit a
<br>
crime. This person takes a holiday over here in Europe, and is arrested for
<br>
violating the Dutch firearms laws because he helped manufacture the gun in
<br>
the US. That is what happened to Dmitry. Is that fair? Is that how we want
<br>
to run this world?
<br>
<p>The principle of applying national laws to anybody that publishes anything
<br>
anywhere in the world is terrifying. If we allow this principle to be used,
<br>
we will never be free again. You will get a choice. You can decide to never
<br>
leave your country for any reason whatsoever. This means you might not even
<br>
be able to attend a wedding or funeral of a loved one. Alternatively, you
<br>
can restrict all your statements to satisfy the laws of all the countries
<br>
you could conceivably travel to. You might as well not say anything,
<br>
because it is very hard to find something that is legal in all
<br>
jurisdictions. We either lose our right to travel, or our right to speak
<br>
and be heard. Which fundamental human right do you want to give up today?
<br>
<p>DMCA does not work
<br>
<p>The DMCA is a fundamentally flawed law. It is ineffective, and actually
<br>
harmful to the interests it tries to protect. It stops me publishing my
<br>
paper now, but someday, someone, somewhere will duplicate my results. This
<br>
person might decide to just publish the HDCP master key on the Internet.
<br>
Instead of fixing HDCP now before it is deployed on a large scale, the
<br>
industry will be confronted with all the expense of building HDCP into
<br>
every device, only to have it rendered useless. The DMCA ends up costing
<br>
the industry money. No points for guessing who ends up paying for it in the
<br>
end.
<br>
<p>In the long run, the DMCA will make it much easier to create illegal
<br>
copies. Why? If we cannot do research in this area, we will never develop
<br>
good copyright protection schemes. We will be stuck with flawed systems
<br>
like HDCP, to the delight of the criminals.
<br>
<p>The DMCA has been called the Snake Oil Protection Act. When a manufacturer
<br>
makes a defective product, you expect them to fix it. Not in this case. The
<br>
DMCA protects the manufacturer of a defective product by making it illegal
<br>
to show that the product is defective. Who came up with this idea?
<br>
<p>Copyright law
<br>
<p>Copyright law is a careful balance between the rights of the author and the
<br>
public interest. The author gets a limited-time exclusive right to
<br>
reproduce his work. The public gets free use of the work once the copyright
<br>
expires. Furthermore, the public gets certain &quot;fair use&quot; rights. These
<br>
include the right to use short quotes from the work in a review, for
<br>
example, and the right to create a parody. If you buy a copy of a
<br>
copyrighted work, you also have the right to make an extra copy for your
<br>
own use. A student can make a copy of a page in his textbook to mark it up
<br>
while he studies.
<br>
<p>In a sneaky way the DMCA eliminates all these &quot;fair use&quot; rights of the
<br>
public. As long as the work is protected using copyright protection
<br>
technology, none of the &quot;fair use&quot; rights can be exercised, because it is
<br>
illegal to create or own the tool with which you can exercise your fair use
<br>
rights. Copyright expires, but the DMCA ensures that even when it does, the
<br>
work still does not enter the public domain. The US supreme court has held
<br>
that the &quot;fair use&quot; rights are exactly the safety valve that prevent the
<br>
copyright law from violating free speech rights. This might be another
<br>
reason why the DMCA is unconstitutional.
<br>
<p>In Dmitry's case, he wrote software that decoded encrypted digital books.
<br>
His software has many uses. Many digital books only allow the book to be
<br>
viewed on the screen. If you are blind and want to read the book on your
<br>
braille display you have to use something like Dmitry's software. This is
<br>
perfectly legal under the &quot;fair use&quot; rules of copyright law, but the DMCA
<br>
forbids it thereby prohibiting blind people from accessing such books.
<br>
<p>Why this mess?
<br>
<p>Why did the movie industry campaign for the DMCA if it doesn't work? The
<br>
movie and record industry have a history of claiming that new technologies
<br>
will bankrupt them. When video recorders were first introduced, they swore
<br>
that they would go bankrupt if people could record movies. Now they make a
<br>
lot of money selling video tapes. Now they swear that they will go bankrupt
<br>
if we do not restrict the freedom of speech and the public's fair use
<br>
rights. Why should we believe them this time around?
<br>
<p>The DMCA exists because the movie and record industry lobbied heavily for
<br>
it. It is a very one-sided law that clearly has not been thought through
<br>
properly. The industry has managed to eliminate the careful balance of the
<br>
copyright law and replace it with a law that effectively gives them an
<br>
unlimited monopoly on copyrighted works. Could it just be that this is the
<br>
real motive behind their lobby?
<br>
<p>Can we fix the DMCA?
<br>
<p>Sure. That wouldn't even be very difficult. Making and selling unauthorised
<br>
copies of copyrighted works is already illegal in most jurisdictions. We
<br>
could change the copyright law to impose stiffer penalties if the copyright
<br>
violation involves breaking a copyright protection scheme. A bit like the
<br>
difference between trespassing and breaking and entering. A law like this
<br>
would achieve exactly what we want: it would restrict illegal copying of
<br>
copyrighted works. It would not restrict the freedom of speech, or do away
<br>
with our fair use rights.
