<br>
Is there really such a thing as altruism in the
<br>
strong sense?  Can there actually be something like &quot;good moral behavior&quot;,
<br>
if such is only a matter of group affiliation? Can morality and
<br>
unselfishness really be reduced to a kind of hedonic calculus of &quot;within
<br>
group niceness&quot;? If this is all we humans are capable of, then how could any
<br>
human have come to the conclusion that it was not only possible, but
<br>
necessary, to love one's enemies as one loves oneself? Are we forever
<br>
destined to &quot;between group nastiness&quot;?

<br>
<p><p>Seventy years ago, A. N. Whitehead wrote that &quot;the art of life is first to
<br>
be alive, secondly to be alive in a satisfactory way, and thirdly to acquire
<br>
an increase in satisfaction.&quot; Some contemporary evolutionary theorists have
<br>
maintained that only the individual who is selfish in every respect will
<br>
survive and thrive in what Whitehead called the art of life. Elliott Sober
<br>
and David Sloan Wilson beg to differ.
<br>
<p>In their widely influential book, Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology
<br>
of Unselfish Behavior (1998), Sober and Wilson use research and reason to
<br>
reshuffle the biological and psychological cards when addressing prevailing
<br>
scientific assumptions about altruism and egoism. The hand they play makes
<br>
their book, as Jeffrey Schloss proclaims, &quot;one of the most controversial and
<br>
significant books to emerge on human evolution, and on altruism, since the
<br>
sociobiological revolution.&quot;
<br>
<p>Because this book has exerted broad influence in the few years since being
<br>
published, I offer this summary review to those wanting to keep abreast of
<br>
significant developments related to science and religion concerns.
<br>
<p>Sober and Wilson argue that evolutionary theory solves problems related to
<br>
biological and psychological egoism and altruism. The authors state
<br>
succinctly the book's agenda by claiming that &quot;the case for evolutionary
<br>
altruism requires showing that group selection has been an important force
<br>
in evolution. The case for psychological altruism requires showing that an
<br>
ultimate concern for the welfare of others is among the psychological
<br>
mechanisms that evolve to motivate adaptive behavior&quot; (6-7).
<br>
<p>The focal point of the evolutionary solution they propose is group selection
<br>
theory. In short, the theory says that individuals sometimes act
<br>
altruistically toward fellow members within the group of which they are a
<br>
part so that the group as a whole survives and thrives.  Group selection
<br>
theory, however, does not lead the authors &quot;to paint a rosy picture of
<br>
universal benevolence.&quot; Instead, &quot;group selection favors within group
<br>
niceness and between group nastiness&quot; (9).
<br>
<p>Group selection theory is actually not a new theory. Until a number of
<br>
biologists attacked the supposition in the 1960s, the theory had many
<br>
adherents. In recent times, however, genetic individualism has prevailed. In
<br>
turn, biological egoism has become orthodoxy in evolutionary biology; most
<br>
biologists have regarded non-kin altruism as illusory. When individuals help
<br>
others, so the current thinking goes, they do so exclusively either to
<br>
receive benefits in return or promote their own genetic self-interest.
<br>
<p>Sober and Wilson offer their book to report and extend &quot;a transition in
<br>
evolutionary thought&quot; that accepts group selection as a biological basis for
<br>
affirming altruism, a transition &quot;that is already in full swing&quot;(7). &quot;Many
<br>
evolutionary biologists continue to play the 'group selection is dead' song
<br>
from the 1960's with the same fondness they have for the Beatles,&quot; the
<br>
authors wryly comment. &quot;Little wonder then, that scholars from other
<br>
disciplines who are interested in evolution have heard almost nothing about
<br>
these scientific developments&quot; (51).
<br>
<p>Psychological altruism has also fallen on hard times. After all, if
<br>
evolutionary altruism is absent in nature, many believe that there is no
<br>
good reason to affirm psychological altruism as truly present in human
<br>
nature. The influence that psychological egoist theory exerts, however, &quot;far
<br>
outreaches the evidence that has been mustered on its behalf,&quot; argue the
<br>
authors (2). &quot;The idea that human behavior is governed entirely by
<br>
self-interest and that altruistic motives don't exist has never been
<br>
supported by either a coherent theory or by a crisp and decisive set of
<br>
observations&quot;(8).
<br>
<p>The book divides into two major parts. In the first, the author's &quot;task is
<br>
show the behaviors that benefit others at the expense of self can evolve.&quot;
<br>
In the second part, their &quot;task is to understand psychological mechanisms
<br>
that evolve to motivate these adaptive behaviors&quot; (17-18).
<br>
<p>The basic point of the first chapter, &quot;Altruism as a Biological Concept,&quot; is
<br>
that &quot;altruism can evolve to the extent that altruists and non-altruists
<br>
become concentrated in different groups&quot; (26). This concentration allows for
<br>
altruism to be maladaptive with respect to individual selection but adaptive
<br>
with respect to group selection. &quot;To be sufficient, the differential fitness
<br>
of groups (the force favoring the altruist) must be strong enough to counter
<br>
the differential fitness of individuals within groups (the force favoring
<br>
the selfish types)&quot; (26). In this way, altruism can evolve as selection
<br>
occurs through groups. (The authors define a group as &quot;a set of individuals
<br>
that influence each other's fitness with respect to a certain trait, but not
<br>
the fitness of those outside the group&quot; [92]).
<br>
<p>The authors note that &quot;despite the importance of motives in conventional
<br>
definitions, evolutionary biologists define altruism entirely in terms of
<br>
survival and reproduction&quot; (17). This means that a behavior is altruistic
<br>
when it increases the survival and reproductive fitness of others and
<br>
decreases the survival and reproductive fitness of the actor.
<br>
<p>Because of what the authors call &quot;the averaging fallacy,&quot; a problem arises
<br>
when comparing altruism and egoism. The problem is that &quot;a single trait can
<br>
appear to be altruistic or selfish depending on whether fitnesses are
<br>
compared within groups or averaged across groups and then compared&quot; (32).
<br>
&quot;When one trait is more fit than another,&quot; explain the authors, &quot;this may be
<br>
due to pure individual selection, to pure group selection, or to a mixture
<br>
of the two. The description of the effect fails to specify what the causes
<br>
were&quot; (33). Sober and Wilson boldly assert that &quot;the entire history of
<br>
evolutionary biology in the last three decades, in which group selection was
<br>
rejected while other frameworks became the foundation for the study of
<br>
social behavior, would have been different if the averaging fallacy had been
<br>
avoided&quot;(157).
<br>
<p>The authors claim that the &quot;evolutionary study of social behavior during the
<br>
last thirty years has reflected a massive confusion between alternative
<br>
theories that evoke different processes, on the one hand, and alternative
<br>
perspectives that view the same process in different ways, on the other&quot;
<br>
(57). The authors believe that it is now possible to offer, as the title of
<br>
the second chapter puts it, &quot;A Unified Evolutionary Theory of Social
<br>
Behavior.&quot; The key to this unified theory &quot;is to achieve a legitimate
<br>
pluralism in which the different processes are distinguished from ways of
<br>
viewing the same process&quot; (57).
<br>
<p>To the end of achieving this legitimate pluralism, the authors consider
<br>
several major biological theories, including kin selection, fitness theory,
<br>
evolutionary game theory, selfish gene theory, and tit-for-tat strategies.
<br>
These &quot;theories were launched as alternatives to group selection,&quot; argue
<br>
Sober and Wilson, but they are &quot;merely different ways of looking a evolution
<br>
in group structured populations&quot; (98). At the very least, the authors
<br>
contend, group selection, as one selection mechanism level (&quot;multi-level
<br>
selection&quot;), must be included in evolutionary biology's pluralist family of
<br>
theories.
<br>
<p>The authors single out kin selection theory (which is the idea that
<br>
individuals are only altruistic toward those to whom they are genetically
<br>
related and therefore those who will pass on their genes) for particular
<br>
appraisal. &quot;For all its insights,&quot; they maintain, &quot;kin selection has led to
<br>
the constricted view that genealogical related is the one and only mechanism
<br>
for the evolution of altruism; because of this theory's widespread
<br>
acceptance, altruism has eclipsed adaptation as the central question of
<br>
social biology.  Multi-level selection theory expands the view by focusing
<br>
on adaptation as the central question and examining the fundamental
<br>
ingredients of natural selection . . . that are required for adaptations to
<br>
evolve at all levels of the biological hierarchy. Altruism can be understood
<br>
only in this context of broader framework&quot; (158). &quot;Replacing kin selection
<br>
theory with multi-level selection theory,&quot; remark the authors, &quot;is like
<br>
shutting off the spotlight and illuminating the entire stage&quot; (332).
<br>
<p>In the third chapter, the authors address directly how multi-level selection
<br>
relates with adaptation. They offer a procedure that involves determining
<br>
what would evolve if either (1) group selection or (2) individual selection
<br>
were the only evolutionary force, and then (3) examining the basic
<br>
ingredients of natural selection at each level of selection. &quot;To the extent
<br>
that a trait has evolved by natural selection,&quot; explain Sober and Wilson,
<br>
&quot;steps one and two bracket the possibilities, with real populations lying
<br>
somewhere in between. The third step involves examining the fundamental
<br>
ingredients of natural selection at each level to see where the population
<br>
is likely to lie between the two extremes of pure between group and pure
<br>
within group selection. . . . This three step procedure makes it clear that
<br>
group selection can be a significant evolutionary force in ways that do not
<br>
require groups of genetic relatives&quot; (157).
<br>
<p>When following this three-step procedure, multi-level selection &quot;furnishes a
<br>
framework for understanding the evolution of our own species&quot; (102). &quot;When
<br>
we view our own species through the lenses of multi-level selection theory,&quot;
<br>
the authors conclude, &quot;we discover that human behavior cannot be placed, in
<br>
its entirety, at one point on the continuum from pure group selection to
<br>
pure individual selection&quot; (130).
<br>
<p>Sober and Wilson apply the theory of group selection to human evolution and
<br>
behavior. After all, multi-level theory should also demand that human groups
<br>
be evaluated in terms of the fundamental ingredients of natural selection.
<br>
The authors conclude that &quot;human social interactions among unrelated
<br>
individuals are anything but random, and our ability to learn and to change
<br>
our behavior according to what we learn provides a powerful mechanism for
<br>
evolution of altruism and other group advantageous behaviors&quot; (142).
<br>
<p>In the final chapter of the book's first part, &quot;Human Groups as Adaptive
<br>
Units,&quot; the authors address specific human cultures. These cultures were
<br>
evaluated and analyzed by a survey from the Human Relations Area Files,
<br>
which is an anthropological database designed to facilitate cross-cultural
<br>
comparisons.  This intriguing chapter provides further strength to the group
<br>
selection theory. &quot;As strange as it may seem against the background of
<br>
individualism,&quot; conclude the authors, &quot;the concept of human groups as
<br>
adaptive units may be supported not only by evolutionary theory but by the
<br>
bulk of empirical information on human social groups in all cultures around
<br>
the world&quot; (193). The authors summarize the chapter and the first part the
<br>
book by saying that &quot;at the behavioral level, it is likely that much of what
<br>
people have evolved to do is for the benefit of the group&quot; (194).
<br>
<p>In the second part of Unto Others, the authors discuss altruism as an issue
<br>
in psychology. They begin by defining terms. Psychological egoism is defined
<br>
as the theory that all our ultimate desires are self-directed. Psychological
<br>
altruism maintains that we sometimes care about others for their own sake.
<br>
The two theories agree that people sometimes desire that others do well.
<br>
However, note the authors, &quot;the debate concerns whether such desires are
<br>
always instrumental or are sometimes ultimate&quot; (201).
<br>
<p>The mind resides at the forefront of the altruism and psychology discussion.
<br>
An evolutionary perspective on human behavior, claim the authors, requires
<br>
one to &quot;regard the human mind as a proximate mechanism for causing organisms
<br>
to produce adaptive behaviors&quot; (200). In particular, &quot;beliefs and desires
<br>
are items in the mind that produce behavior&quot; (208). Yet, argue Sober and
<br>
Wilson, &quot;an organism need not have a mind to be an evolutionary altruist.&quot;
<br>
Furthermore, &quot;you don't have to beliefs and desires to be evolutionary
<br>
altruist&quot; (202).
<br>
<p>The authors summarize their thought by saying that, &quot;in the debate between
<br>
egoism and altruism, everyone agrees that some of the desires that people
<br>
have are egoistic in character. We have suggested that individuals are able
<br>
to have these uncontroversial desires only if they have the concept of an
<br>
'I.' Being able to use this concept does not require self-awareness, but
<br>
merely self-recognition. Organisms that form perpetual beliefs that
<br>
represent objects in their environment in terms of how those objects are
<br>
related to self may plausibly be thought of as employing the concept of 'I'&quot;
<br>
(216-17).
<br>
<p>In one of the most helpful and provocative chapters, Sober and Wilson
<br>
examine, as the chapter title puts it, &quot;Three Theories of Motivation.&quot; The
<br>
three theories they have in mind are hedonism, egoism, and altruism.
<br>
<p>The authors define hedonism as the theory that &quot;the only ultimate desires
<br>
that people have are the desires to obtain pleasure and avoid pain.&quot; &quot;The
<br>
distinctive feature of hedonism,&quot; the authors add, &quot;is that it says that
<br>
ultimate desires are always solipsistic&quot; (224).
<br>
<p>Egoism is defined as the theory that &quot;the only ultimate goals an individual
<br>
has are self-directed; people desire their own well-being, and nothing else,
<br>
as end in itself&quot;(224). The point is made that, although all hedonists are
<br>
egoists, not all egoists are hedonists. After all, an egoist may desire pain
<br>
for herself and avoid experiencing personal pleasure.
<br>
<p>Altruism is defined as the theory that &quot;people sometimes care about the
<br>
welfare of others as an end in itself.&quot; The authors quickly note that they
<br>
regard altruism as &quot;part of the pluralistic theory of motivation that
<br>
maintains that people have ultimate desires about others as well as about
<br>
themselves.&quot; This means that their version of altruism &quot;is quite compatible
<br>
with the existence of widespread selfishness&quot; (228). However, pluralism and
<br>
egoism, as they define them, are incompatible, because egoism claims that
<br>
people ultimately desire nothing but their own well-being.
<br>
<p>The authors remark that their theory of pluralistic motivation can be said
<br>
to describe an organism's behavior in two ways. &quot;One possibility is that
<br>
some of the actions the organism performs are caused solely by altruistic
<br>
ultimate motives while others are caused just by egoistic ultimate motives.&quot;
<br>
Another possibility is that an organism's actions &quot;are caused by both
<br>
altruistic and egoistic ultimate motives&quot; (308).
<br>
<p>Sober and Wilson examine the common practice of equating altruism and
<br>
morality. They make several important claims. They claim that, first,
<br>
morality does not always require one to sacrifice self-interest for the sake
<br>
of others. Second, being motivated by an altruistic desire is not the same
<br>
as being motivated by a moral principle. Third, altruistically motivated
<br>
actions can be morally wrong, while selfishly motivated actions may be
<br>
morally required. Finally, altruism, as the authors understand it, does not
<br>
require that one care about the welfare of another for purely other-directed
<br>
reasons: &quot;the hypothesis does not rule out the possibility that instances of
<br>
helping are sometimes or even always accompanied by ultimate motives that
<br>
are self-directed&quot; (246).
<br>
<p>Chapters eight and nine are less provocative than previous chapters. The
<br>
authors examine psychological evidence and determine that this evidence does
<br>
not prove conclusively whether or not human beings ever have altruistic
<br>
ultimate motives. The evidence, however, does not prove the egoist
<br>
hypothesis either. The main reason that psychological evidence does not
<br>
wholly confirm the truth of egoism or altruism (or pluralism) is that,
<br>
according to the authors, introspection does not inerrantly reveal to us our
<br>
ultimate desires. The authors draw the same conclusion when discussing the
<br>
philosophical arguments regarding egoism and altruism (or pluralism) as they
<br>
did when discussing the psychological evidence for the debate. That is, they
<br>
conclude that philosophical arguments are inconclusive.
<br>
<p>The book's final chapter shows how evolutionary considerations bear on the
<br>
question of psychological motivation. The authors intrepidly claim that &quot;no
<br>
version of egoism is plausible for organisms such as ourselves&quot; (297), by
<br>
which they apparently mean that egoism, when defined as the theory that the
<br>
only ultimate goals an individual ever has are self-directed, is not
<br>
plausible as an explanation of human behavior.  At the center of the
<br>
chapter's discussion is the parent-child relationship. &quot;We can conjecture
<br>
that human parents typically want their children to do well -- to live
<br>
rather than die, to be healthy rather than sick, and so on,&quot; state Sober and
<br>
Wilson. &quot;The question we will address is whether this desire is merely an
<br>
instrumental desire in the service in some egoistic ultimate goal, or part
<br>
of a pluralistic motivational system in which there is an ultimate
<br>
altruistic concern for the child's welfare. We will argue that there are
<br>
evolutionary reasons to expect motivational pluralism to be the proximate
<br>
mechanism for producing parental care in our species&quot; (302). In fact,
<br>
&quot;parental care would be more reliably produced by purely altruistic motives
<br>
than by purely hedonistic motives&quot; (319).
<br>
<p>In a chapter subsection entitled, &quot;A Continuum of Cognitive Capacities,&quot; the
<br>
authors note that humans and other organisms are cognitively limited.  The
<br>
authors lay out a continuum in which a simple conditionable organism at one
<br>
end of the continuum has no, or virtually no, cognitive abilities. At the
<br>
other end of the continuum is the hypothetical individual with unlimited
<br>
cognitive abilities. &quot;Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that
<br>
cognition began to evolve in organisms that already had the capacity to
<br>
experience pleasure and pain,&quot; the authors venture. &quot;Even if the first
<br>
organisms that had desires were hedonists, what circumstances could make it
<br>
selectively advantageous for organisms to depart from the dictates of
<br>
hedonism by having some of their behaviors regulated by purely altruistic
<br>
motives?&quot; (311) The answer given is that those organisms with greater
<br>
cognitive resources might be motivated to be pluralistically motivated. In
<br>
fact, the authors eventually contend that &quot;pluralism was probably available
<br>
ancestrally, if hedonism was&quot; (322).
<br>
<p>Those organisms with sophisticated cognitive abilities have greater capacity
<br>
for, and reason to, act upon pluralistic motivations. &quot;The obvious
<br>
evolutionary strategy for an organism that can form reliable beliefs about
<br>
its own body and about the welfare of relevant others,&quot; conclude the
<br>
authors, &quot;is for it to set its eyes on the prize.&quot; The organism's &quot;ultimate
<br>
desire should include a concern for something that is far more important in
<br>
terms of evolutionary success than the states of its own consciousness&quot;
<br>
(324).
<br>
<p>The authors conclude their discussion of how psychological altruism evolved
<br>
by tying together the example of the parent-child relationship with group
<br>
selection theory. &quot;Just as motivational pluralism is a plausible design
<br>
solution for the problem of getting parents to take care of their children,
<br>
so pluralism is a plausible design solution for the problem of getting
<br>
members of a group to take care of each other&quot; (326). In short, &quot;evolution
<br>
has made us motivational pluralists, not egoists or hedonists&quot; (327).
