DURHAM, N.C. -- Humans could be technically easier to clone than sheep, cows,
<br>
pigs and mice because humans possess a genetic benefit that prevents fetal
<br>
overgrowth, a major obstacle encountered in cloning animals, according to new
<br>
research by Duke University Medical Center scientists.
<br>
<p>The genetic benefit seems subtle, say the researchers, but it is so important
<br>
that it creates fundamental differences between humans and other animals in
<br>
the
<br>
way they regulate fetal growth and cancer susceptibility. The research is
<br>
published in the Aug. 15, 2001 issue of Human Molecular Genetics.
<br>
<p>The genetic benefit they found was this: humans and other primates possess two
<br>
activated copies of a gene called insulin-like growth factor II receptor
<br>
(IGF2R). Offspring receive one functional copy from each parent, as expected.
<br>
However, sheep, pigs, mice and virtually all non-primate mammals receive only
<br>
one functional copy of this gene because of a rare phenomenon known as genomic
<br>
imprinting, in which the gene is literally stamped with markings that turn off
<br>
its function.
<br>
<p>With the second copy of the gene permanently imprinted, such animals are more
<br>
prone to two major problems -- developing cancer and suffering from cloning
<br>
complications like overly large offspring, immature lung development, enlarged
<br>
hearts and reduced immunity to disease, say the scientists.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the first concrete genetic data showing that the cloning process
<br>
could
<br>
be less complicated in humans than in sheep,&quot; said Keith Killian, a Duke
<br>
University Medical Center molecular evolutionist and first author of the
<br>
study.
<br>
&quot;Only one in 300 sheep embryos takes hold, and up to half of these embryos
<br>
have
<br>
large offspring syndrome, which can kill the mother and the fetus. Since
<br>
humans
<br>
are not imprinted at IGF2R, then fetal overgrowth would not be predicted to
<br>
occur if humans were cloned.&quot;
<br>
<p>The problems associated with cloning an imprinted animal occur when scientists
<br>
manipulate the fledgling embryos in the laboratory, the Duke researchers said.
<br>
While the IGF2R gene remains intact, the &quot;epigenetic&quot; markings -- crucial
<br>
information layered on top of the gene sequence -- are inadvertently damaged
<br>
and alter the way the gene functions, said Randy Jirtle, professor of
<br>
radiation
<br>
oncology at Duke.
<br>
<p>Jirtle compares the IGF2R gene to computer hardware that is functioning
<br>
properly, and its epigenetic markings to computer software that is damaged or
<br>
defective. The computer will not run if the software does not work.
<br>
<p>Jirtle said humans are not subject to these epigenetic alterations because,
<br>
according to their research, humans are not imprinted at IGF2R. For reasons
<br>
unknown, he says, the very state of being imprinted appears to make imprinted
<br>
animals more susceptible to epigenetic damage.
<br>
<p>However, many scientists have believed that up to 50 percent of people are
<br>
imprinted at the IGF2R gene and are more susceptible to cancer and,
<br>
potentially, cloning complications. But the Duke scientists, using the latest
<br>
gene mapping technology, found no evidence that any humans possess an
<br>
imprinted
<br>
IGF2R. Also, decades of successfully manipulating human embryos through in
<br>
vitro fertilization have not resulted in large offspring syndrome.
<br>
<p>While it is true that the IGF2R gene is frequently mutated in human breast,
<br>
colon, head and neck, liver and lung cancers, the researchers said that is not
<br>
because humans are imprinted at IGF2R. The gene, like any other involved in
<br>
cancer, simply becomes mutated, or defective, for a variety of reasons
<br>
unrelated to imprinting. Mutating two copies of the IGF2R gene is much more
<br>
difficult and statistically unlikely than mutating a single copy, which is why
<br>
mice and other imprinted animals are far more susceptible to cancer than are
<br>
humans, said Jirtle.
<br>
<p>Because mice and rats comprise 90 percent of the animals used in research,
<br>
scientists should take into account the rodents' genetic susceptibility to
<br>
cancer when they are applying their study conclusions to humans, said Killian.
<br>
Clinical development of hundreds of potential disease-treating drugs have been
<br>
abandoned after rodent studies have shown them to be potential carcinogens --
<br>
studies that might have had a different outcome if rodents possessed two
<br>
functional copies of IGF2R. &quot;You could theoretically give new life to
<br>
thousands
<br>
of discarded compounds by retesting them in animals that, like humans, have
<br>
both functional copies of IGF2R,&quot; said Killian.
<br>
<p>To test for the presence of imprinting in humans and other mammals, the Duke
<br>
team used six different single nucleotide polymorphisms, distinctive genetic
<br>
markers called &quot;SNIPs.&quot; Scientists worldwide are now using SNIPs to map the
<br>
entire human genome because the older method, variable number tandem repeat
<br>
(VNTR), frequently produces ambiguous results.
<br>
<p>&quot;VNTRs are antiquated and error prone because the enzymes used to amplify the
<br>
DNA jump backward and forward,&quot; said Killian. &quot;When you go to analyze the
<br>
results, the picture you get is smeared and therefore ambiguous.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Duke team's results definitively showed that human IGF2R is not imprinted.
<br>
The gene is also not imprinted in primates or our closest non-primate
<br>
relatives, including tree shrews and lemurs. In fact, the team's evolutionary
<br>
research shows that all these mammals lost imprinting of the IGF2R gene
<br>
approximately 70 million years ago. The modern-day absence of imprinting in
<br>
all
<br>
primates and their closest relatives bolsters the team's genetic data showing
<br>
that no humans are imprinted at IGF2R, said Jirtle. &quot;While there are
<br>
approximately 45 imprinted genes identified in mammals, IGF2R is the only gene
<br>
known to have gained imprinting at one point and later lost it during primate
<br>
evolution,&quot; said Jirtle.
<br>
<p>In contrast, IGF2R is still imprinted in all other placental mammals and
<br>
marsupials included in their study -- including opossums, mice, rats, sheep,
<br>
cows and pigs. The divergence of imprinting among various classes of mammals
<br>
millions of years ago suggests that they embarked on separate evolutionary
<br>
paths that gave rise to the unique genetic traits they possess today.
<br>
<p>&quot;Knowing where on the evolutionary scale IGF2R imprinting appeared and
<br>
subsequently vanished will enable scientists to select animal models better
<br>
suited for making accurate inferences about human clonability and cancer
<br>
susceptibility,&quot; said Jirtle. &quot;If you don't know how animals are related to
<br>
each other, there is no way to accurately extrapolate the experimental results
<br>
from one species to another.&quot;
