<br>
By Michelle Delio 
<br>
<p>2:00 a.m. July 20, 2001 PDT  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Many geeks will survive death and go on to a glorious future --
<br>
assuming that medical science figures out a way to defrost and
<br>
reanimate them. 
<br>
<p>According to a new book, The Mummy Congress: Science, Obsession and
<br>
the Everlasting Dead, techies make up a large percentage of those who
<br>
have signed up for cryonic suspension, an experimental procedure used
<br>
to preserve legally dead bodies in the hopes that future medical
<br>
breakthroughs will allow them to be brought back to life. 
<br>

<br>
<p>Those who have opted for cryonic suspension will be packed in ice as
<br>
soon as they die. Soon after, their body fluids will be replaced with
<br>
a glycerin-based solution that acts as a kind of anti-freeze. 
<br>
<p>Their flesh will be cooled with liquid nitrogen to minus-320 degrees
<br>
Fahrenheit, and their bodies will then be placed in a large metal
<br>
cooler called a cryostat, where they will await the medical
<br>
breakthrough that will allow them to return to life. 
<br>
<p>Heather Pringle, author of The Mummy Congress, said she was surprised
<br>
to find out how many tech-savvy people intend to end their days as
<br>
Popsicles. 
<br>
<p>Pringle's book examines the long history of humans' efforts to
<br>
preserve their mortal remains. 
<br>
<p>When she began to research the chapter on modern mummification, she
<br>
visited cryogenic labs, expecting to find that the client list would
<br>
include &quot;your new-age crowd, people with strange ideas about the body
<br>
and soul and maybe with bizarre beliefs about immortality and
<br>
eternity. Kind of a well-heeled version of the folks who believe Elvis
<br>
lives.&quot; 
<br>
<p>But Pringle said that when she really thought about it, geeks on ice
<br>
made perfect sense. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Silicon Valley crowd has an enormous faith in technology and the
<br>
science of progress,&quot; she said. &quot;They believe that you can conquer
<br>
just about any problem if you throw enough money and technology after
<br>
it -- so why not immortality?&quot; 
<br>
<p>Pringle also noted that &quot;unlike many of us,&quot; tech-oriented people
<br>
actually welcome the future and wouldn't mind living in it. 
<br>
<p>Pringle said she loves the image of entire warehouses stacked full of
<br>
hackers, programmers and engineers, but thinks it is highly unlikely
<br>
that the super-cooled techies will ever be defrosted and rebooted. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The technological problems in doing this seem just staggering to me,
<br>
particularly for people who go the economy-class route, having only
<br>
their heads preserved,&quot; Pringle said. 
<br>
<p>&quot;To bring back to full functioning something as complex as a brain,
<br>
and then to graft it back on to a body, just seems horrifically
<br>
difficult.&quot; 
<br>
<p>But Ralph Merkle, a nanotechnology researcher who maintains a Web page
<br>
on cryonics, said the correct scientific answer to the question &quot;does
<br>
cryonics work?&quot; is neither yes nor no. &quot;The clinical trials are in
<br>
progress,&quot; Merkle said. &quot;Come back in a century and we'll give you a
<br>
reliable answer.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Merkle is also a member of the board of directors at Alcor, a cryonic
<br>
suspension facility in Scottsdale, Arizona, one of the three cryonic
<br>
suspension facilities in the United States. 
<br>
<p>Alcor has recently adopted new suspension protocols, which vitrify
<br>
rather than freeze. Freezing produces ice, the crystalline form of
<br>
water. Vitrifying cools water, but does not produce ice so the water
<br>
molecules remain disordered and in a non-crystalline form, Merkle
<br>
said. 
<br>
<p>This process also uses new cryoprotectants and ice blockers to
<br>
eliminate ice damage to the body's systems. 
<br>
<p>Merkle firmly believes that current suspension methods can preserve
<br>
the structures in the human brain that encode long-term memory and
<br>
personality.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;The synapses are still there, the neurons are still there, the
<br>
dendrites are still there -- all present and accounted for. Thus, at
<br>
some point in the future, a medical technology based on a mature
<br>
nanotechnology should be able to restore good health with memory and
<br>
personality intact,&quot; Merkle said. 
<br>
<p>Merkle maintains a rather impressive list on his website of computer
<br>
scientists, software developers and other tech professionals who have
<br>
signed up for cryonic suspension. 
<br>
<p>The key to cryonics' eventual success is nanotechnology, manipulating
<br>
materials on an atomic or molecular scale, according to most techies
<br>
who are interested in cryonic suspension. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Current medical science does not have the tools to fix damage that
<br>
occurs at the cellular and molecular level, and damage to these
<br>
systems is the cause of vast majority of fatal illnesses,&quot; said Paul
<br>
Jones, a programmer planning to sign on for cryonic suspension of his
<br>
head. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I fully expect to wake up some day, a few hundred years from now,
<br>
whole and healthy and alive,&quot; Jones said. 
<br>
<p>Jones, who lives in Ontario, said that &quot;with the current exchange rate
<br>
for Canadian dollars&quot; he can't afford to have his entire body
<br>
preserved. 
<br>
<p>At Alcor, cryonic suspension of a whole body costs $120,000;
<br>
neurosuspension (just the head) costs $50,000. Alcor also charges a
<br>
one-time, &quot;lifetime membership&quot; payment of $20,000, which can be paid
<br>
off at the rate of $100 a month for 20 years for a total of $24,000. 
<br>
<p>Transtime &quot;recommends&quot; that people provide a minimum of $150,000 for
<br>
whole-body suspension. Part of this sum pays for the initial costs of
<br>
the suspension. The balance is placed in a trust fund, with the income
<br>
used to pay the continued cost of maintaining you in suspension.
<br>
Transtime can do neurosuspensions but does not promote the option. 
<br>
<p>Transtime also charges a yearly fee of $96 for membership, with the
<br>
price halved to $48 for other family members. 
<br>
<p>The Cryonics Institute in Clinton Township, Michigan, charges $28,000
<br>
for a full-body suspension, along with a one-time payment of $1,250.
<br>
The Cryonics Institute does not do neurosuspension. 
<br>
<p>Pringle wonders if the dot-com bust will cause people to put their
<br>
suspension plans on ice instead of their bodies. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Cryogenics is incredibly pricey, and when the financial bottom has
<br>
just fallen out of your world, you are likely to put your plans for
<br>
the afterlife on hold.&quot; 
<br>
<p>But Merkle said that interest in cryonics doesn't vary according to
<br>
short-term fluctuations in the stock market. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Most people pay for cryonics with a life insurance policy which pays
<br>
the fee to the suspension facility upon the death of the policy
<br>
holder. A ... life insurance policy for someone in good health might
<br>
be only $200 per year,&quot; Merkle said. 
<br>
<p>&quot;So cryonics is within the reach of most people, the primary issue
<br>
being whether or not you want to do it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>About 90 people in the United Stated are already in suspension, with
<br>
hundreds more signed on for the service. 
<br>
<p>Pringle wonders what people of the future will think about our
<br>
civilization when they break open all those canisters containing
<br>
nerds' bodies and heads. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Instead of preserving the finest physical specimens of 21st-century
<br>
humanity -- the athletic, the attractive, the physically fit, the
<br>
Adonis and Venus de Milo types whose bodies are so well deserving of
<br>
eternity -– we seem to be conserving geeks with taped-up glasses and
<br>
bad haircuts, people whose idea of dinner ranges only a little further
<br>
than Frito-Lays, Cheetos and Jolt,&quot; Pringle said. 
<br>
<p>&quot;What a warped view the 40th century will have of the rest of us.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Pringle hastens to add that her husband is a software programmer.
