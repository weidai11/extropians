From: &quot;Eugene Leitl&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de?Subject=Re:%20Vicious%20Racism%20was%20RE:%20Reparations&In-Reply-To=&lt;00e201c11d1b$9f436080$cf5c2a42@jrmolloy&gt;">Eugene.Leitl@lrz.uni-muenchen.de</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why are you replying to my messages?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I'm trying to understand what makes you tick, and I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; succeeding very well so far.
</em><br>
<p>Do you really want to understand what makes me tick? Do I tick? Human beings
<br>
are still behaving with animal instincts, and the animal instincts, it seems,
<br>
may be overpowering in their intensity and speed. It may be that it is only
<br>
natural for both adults and children to respond to life with animal instincts.
<br>
Which means that after a million years, we are still instinctively behaving
<br>
like our ancestors in some ways. Probably our behavior is also complicated by
<br>
thought; the animal instinct has now become entangled with thought, and it is
<br>
getting in some ways worse, far worse. Because all these instincts of hatred
<br>
now become directed and sustained by thought, so that they are more subtle and
<br>
dangerous. During all these many centuries we haven't found a way, a method, a
<br>
system -- something that will move us away from that track. One of the
<br>
difficulties is that when people begin to be angry with each other, their
<br>
anger builds up and they can't seem to do anything about it. They may try to
<br>
control it, but that doesn't work. If someone behaves naturally in a way that
<br>
is not a response to the animal instinct, what place has this kind of insight
<br>
in human society? None at all? In society as it is, it cannot be accommodated,
<br>
because society is organized under the assumption that pain and pleasure are
<br>
going to rule. You could say that friendliness is a kind of animal instinct
<br>
too, for people become friendly for instinctive reasons. And perhaps they
<br>
become enemies for similar reasons. So I think that some people would way that
<br>
we should be rational rather than instinctive. There was a period during the
<br>
18th century, the Age of Reason, when they said man could be rational, could
<br>
choose to be rational, in order to bring about harmony everywhere. But
<br>
humanity has not done so. No, things got worse, leading to the French
<br>
Revolution, to the Terror and so on. After that, people didn't have so much
<br>
faith in reason as a way of getting anywhere, or coming out of conflict. So
<br>
where does that lead us? Can insight actually change the nature of the brain
<br>
itself? By dispelling the ignorance in the brain, insight allows the brain to
<br>
function in a new way. Thought has been operating in ignorance, crating its
<br>
own ignorance and functioning in that. And insight is like a flash which
<br>
breaks down the ignorance. Then when that insight clears the ignorance, does
<br>
humanity act, or function, rationally? Yes, humanity will then function
<br>
rationally, and with perception, rather than by rules and reason. But there is
<br>
a freely flowing reason. You see, some people identify reason with certain
<br>
rules of logic which would be mechanical. But there can be reason as a form of
<br>
perception of order. So, is insight perception? It is the flash of light that
<br>
makes perception possible. It is even more fundamental than perception. So
<br>
insight is pure perception, and from that perception there is action, which is
<br>
then sustained by rationality, and the rationality is perception of order.
<br>
That order is not mechanical because it is not based on logic. There are no
<br>
rules. This order is not based on rules. This means insight, perception,
<br>
action, order... then you come to the question, is insight continuous, or is
<br>
it by flashes? Or perhaps we can look at it differently. It is not time
<br>
binding. So now let's get a little further. Insight is the elimination of the
<br>
ignorance which is the very center of the self, the ignorance that self
<br>
creates. Insight dispels that very center. With the ignorance, perception is
<br>
not possible. It's blindness in a way. What next? I am an ordinary human, with
<br>
all my animal instincts, pleasure and pain and reward and punishment and so
<br>
on. I hear you say this, and I see what you are saying has some kind of
<br>
reason, logic and order. It makes sense as far as we can see it. Then how am I
<br>
to have reason in my life? How am I to bring it about? You understand that
<br>
these words which are difficult, are all of them time binding. But is that
<br>
possible? Yes, without time, you see. Is it possible for humanity, with its
<br>
narrow focus on practicality, to have this insight, so that the old pattern of
<br>
life is broken? We have tried all this, tried every form of self-denial, and
<br>
yet that insight doesn't come about. Once in a while there is a partial
<br>
insight, but that partial insight is not the whole insight, so there is still
<br>
partial ignorance. Which doesn't dispel the center of the self. It may dispel
<br>
some ignorance in a certain area, but the source of the ignorance, the cause,
<br>
the sustainer of it, is still there. Now what shall we do? But this is a wrong
<br>
question. This leads nowhere. We have stated the general plan. And one has to
<br>
make the moves, or make no moves at all. I haven't the energy. I haven't the
<br>
capacity to see it quickly. Because this is immediate, not just something that
<br>
I practice and eventually get. I haven't the capacity, I haven't the sense of
<br>
urgency, of immediacy. Everything is against me: family, colleagues, society.
<br>
Everything. And does this mean that I eventually have to become a monk? No.
<br>
Becoming a monk is the same as becoming anything else. Becoming a monk is like
<br>
becoming a businessman. I see all this, verbally as well as rationally,
<br>
intellectually, but I can't capture this thing. Is there a different approach
<br>
to this problem? I am always asking the same question, because I am caught in
<br>
the same pattern. So, is there a totally different way? A totally different
<br>
approach to the whole turmoil of life? Is there a different way of looking at
<br>
it? Or is the old way the only way?
<br>
As long as the center is creating ignorance, and thought is operating in that
<br>
darkness, there must be disorder, and society will be as it is now. To move
<br>
away from that, you must have insight. Insight can only come about when there
<br>
is a flash, a sudden light, which abolishes not only ignorance but the cause
<br>
of ignorance. Is there a different approach to this question altogether, even
<br>
though the old response seems absolute? Possibly. Do we want a less absolute
<br>
approach? If that is the only way, then we are doomed. You can't produce this
<br>
flash at will. It can't be produced through will, through sacrifice, through
<br>
any form of human effort. That is out, and we have finished with all that. to
<br>
some people, this insight seemed so natural we asked why is it not natural to
<br>
others. It seems natural to children to respond with animal instincts, with
<br>
great intensity which sweeps them away. Ignorance arises because it is so
<br>
overwhelming. Why is it different with others? First of all it seems natural
<br>
to most people that the animal instincts would take over. And they would say
<br>
the others are unnatural. So that is the way humankind has been thinking,
<br>
saying that if there are indeed any people who are different they must be very
<br>
unusual and unnatural. Humans have been responding to hatred with hatred, and
<br>
so on. There are those few, perhaps many, who say that is not natural or
<br>
rational. Why has this division taken place?
<br>
If we say that pleasure and pain, fear and hate, are natural, then it is felt
<br>
that we must battle to control these, otherwise they will destroy us. The best
<br>
we can hope for is to control them with reason, or through another way. But
<br>
that doesn't work. Are people of insight, who function differently, the
<br>
privileged few, by some miracle, by some strange chance event? Many people
<br>
would say that. But it goes against one's grain. I would not accept that. So,
<br>
why is there this difference? People of insight are born of the same DNA.
<br>
Fundamentally the same. So why do the insightful behave differently? This
<br>
question has been asked many times, over and over again in different parts of
<br>
the world. Now why is there this division? The division is entire and
<br>
complete. But because people say that they want to escape ignorance, does not
<br>
mean that they actually understand the state they are in, and want to
<br>
deliberately get out of it. They feel ambivalent about it. They want to go on
<br>
getting the rewards from their life style, but they have a sense that it is
<br>
wrong, and that it leads to suffering. Or else they find they can't help it.
<br>
You see, when the time comes to experience anger or pleasure, they can't get
<br>
away from it. They can't help it. Although they are helpless, they want to get
<br>
out of it. So what shall we do? Or is this division false? These two
<br>
approaches don't have anything in common. Although people are fundamentally
<br>
the same, and therefore the difference is false, a difference has developed
<br>
between them. Perhaps most people have taken a wrong turn in their lives.
<br>
But the difference is not intrinsic, it is not structural, built in like the
<br>
difference between a rock and a tree. The difference between the ignorant and
<br>
the insightful is not like that. There are two responses. They start from the
<br>
source; one has taken one direction, and the other has taken a different
<br>
direction. But the source is the same. Why haven't all of them moved in the
<br>
right direction? If one understands that, then going back to the source, one
<br>
does not have to take the wrong turn. In a sense we are continually taking
<br>
this wrong turn, so if we can understand this, then it becomes possible to
<br>
change. And we are continually starting from the same source, not going back
<br>
in time to a source. There seem to be two possible ways of taking our
<br>
statement. One is to say that the source is in time, that far back in the past
<br>
we started together and took different paths. The other is to say that the
<br>
source is timeless, and we are continually taking the wrong turn, again and
<br>
again. Why do we constantly take the wrong turn? We can't go back, so it is
<br>
apparent that we are taking the wrong turn all the time, constantly. Why? The
<br>
one who is living with insight and the other who is not -- are these constant?
<br>
The one who is living in ignorance can move away from it at any time. Nothing
<br>
holds one to ignorance except constantly, habitually taking this wrong turn.
<br>
You could say the ignorance is such that one doesn't see oneself taking the
<br>
wrong turn. Are we pursuing the correct direction, putting the right question?
<br>
Suppose you have insight, and your ignorance, the very center of ignorance,
<br>
has been dispelled completely. A fairly serious and intelligent person listens
<br>
to you, and whatever you say seems reasonable, rational, sane. So where is the
<br>
division, which is created by the center which creates ignorance? Thought has
<br>
created it.
<br>
In ignorance, thought creates the division. From ignorance a shadow is cast,
<br>
and it defines a division. If we have that insight, we say there is no
<br>
division. Humanity won't accept that, because in its ignorance there is
<br>
nothing but division. So we, living in ignorance, have created the division.
<br>
We have created it in our thoughts; we are constantly creating it, and always
<br>
wanting to live constantly in a state in which there is no division. That
<br>
movement, is still the movement of ignorance.
<br>
How are we to dispel this continuous, constant ignorance? As long as it
<br>
exists, we create this constant division, and this keeps going round in
<br>
circles. We can only dispel the ignorance through insight, and we cannot have
<br>
that insight by any effort of will, so we are left with nothing. So the
<br>
problem is to perceive the ignorance, to perceive the thought that is creating
<br>
ignorance, and see that the self is the source of this ignorance. Why can't
<br>
one see that? Logic doesn't seem to operate. So what shall we do when we
<br>
understand for the first time that the self is creating the ignorance which is
<br>
constantly breeding division? Actually, there is no division, but only the
<br>
illusion of division. In a way the thought process spontaneously produces the
<br>
illusion of division. If we try to put it aside, it is at the same time trying
<br>
to make division. So this seems a wrong way to go about it. Dualistic thinking
<br>
cannot put away division. Insight tells us there is no division, and we
<br>
recognize that, and it has an immediate effect. Having lived with dualism,
<br>
what effect does the understanding of unity have? It brings a response of
<br>
tremendous shock. It changes our whole way of seeing, and breaks the old
<br>
pattern with this fundamental truth. There is no division between nature and
<br>
humanity. Where hatred exists, this insight does not. But while hating, one
<br>
wants insight. Constant division emerges from constant denial of this
<br>
conflict. Seeing reality as a unified totality dispels the denial.
<br>
Effortlessly, insight comes to the brain.
<br>
Can one listen even while living in constant ignorance? Yes, and if one can't
<br>
one is doomed. This is no argument, it is simply the way reality is. Living in
<br>
ignorance is useless, except as it provides opportunity to listen to insight.
<br>
Listening carefully and sensitively, one awakens to the unity of reality, and
<br>
knows that one has been living in illusory dualism, and this brings that
<br>
constant division to an end. Otherwise, if this doesn't happen, we have
<br>
nothing. Formerly we lived in perpetual ignorance, but listening to this
<br>
insight has an extraordinary effect, and reaches the source of the movement,
<br>
whereas passive observation does not. We have observed, listened, played all
<br>
kinds of games all our lives, and we now see that there is only one existence,
<br>
that there is this constant ignoring of it, and acting in that ignorance; in
<br>
this chaos which is ignorance; whose center is the self. Seeing that
<br>
completely, argument disappears. It is like water quenching thirst, this
<br>
insight dispels duality. We realize that the constant movement of ignoring
<br>
reality or seeing it through the filter of ideation has been our life. With
<br>
all the experience and knowledge collected over millions of years, humanity
<br>
suddenly can see that we've been living in total ignorance, which means we've
<br>
reached the end of all hope, and that hope is also ignorant, the future is
<br>
just more illusion and we're left with enormous darkness. Understanding that
<br>
ends the process of becoming. Reaching this point is natural, and allows us to
<br>
see all religions rely on the illusion of duality. They repeat the pattern by
<br>
saying this duality can be overcome. But when there is insight, there is no
<br>
duality. It is not my insight or your insight, it is insight, and in that
<br>
there is no duality, no division. This brings us to the ground of being, which
<br>
is not divided and in which nothing emerges of will, or time, or thought.
<br>
There is something other than light and dark; a perception of movement which
<br>
is not divided. The ground of being is endless movement. Apart from time,
<br>
apart from the movement from being to becoming (psychologically), is the
<br>
ground of being, and it has no end, no beginning. The ground of being is
<br>
timeless, formless, and flows without division. Understanding the significance
<br>
and depth of that reveals existence extends beyond time and distance. The
<br>
ground of being surrounds and envelops us. The cosmos, the multiverse, the
<br>
whole, the totality, whatever we decide to call it, only that exists. Can
<br>
human awareness be of that timeless movement, the totality? It is timeless,
<br>
and therefore deathless. The ground of being is without death, and in so far
<br>
as awareness engages it, it is the same. That which dies when the individual
<br>
dies has no importance, and has very little meaning. The ending of a body is
<br>
totally trivial. Understanding the significance of the statement that there is
<br>
no duality in reality breaks the spell of ignorance, and we see there is the
<br>
movement of the ground of being, and that's all. Which means death has very
<br>
little meaning. Suddenly the fear of death drops away when awareness engages
<br>
the ground of being, then awareness is the movement of the ground of being.
<br>
Matter and energy, everything is that movement. In our darkness we have
<br>
listened to insight, and this clarity has broken our spell of the illusion of
<br>
duality between life and death. One can never say then, I am immortal. It is
<br>
so childish, because it is based on the false duality of life and death which
<br>
comes from the self. Insight has wiped away the whole sense of living in
<br>
denial of the unity of reality. What importance have the struggles of
<br>
humanity? They are like struggling in a locked room.
<br>
Can this insight with its ending of conflict affect the neurons of the brain?
<br>
It has been shown that under stress brain cells start to break down. Science
<br>
and knowledge have evolved, but in the last ten thousand years the human brain
<br>
has not. In the silence and stillness of meditation, pure awareness emerges in
<br>
the ground of being, and struggle comes to an end. This extraordinary event
<br>
affects everyday life by going beyond aggression, becoming, striving, and so
<br>
on.
