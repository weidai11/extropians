<p>I wish the store managers who stayed up nights thinking about how they could

<p>Who's minding the kids? Few options for migrants
<br>
<p>By Jolayne Houtz
<br>
Seattle Times staff reporter
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KEVIN GERMAN / THE SEATTLE TIMES
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan Bernal, 10, left, Daniel Valencia, 11, right, and Maritza
<br>
De La Cruz, 2, watch neighbor kids play in Mattawa, Grant County.
<br>
<p><p>WENATCHEE - Angelica Navarro used to wrap one end of a string around her
<br>
daughter's braids and the other around a cherry tree.
<br>
With farm machinery, pesticides and snakes in the orchards, this makeshift
<br>
child care was the only way Navarro knew to keep the 3-year-old safe while
<br>
she worked.
<br>
<p>&quot;I was afraid a tractor would run her over,&quot; Navarro said after a day
<br>
picking cherries in Wenatchee. &quot;Sometimes, there's nothing else to do but
<br>
bring (her children) to the orchard ... But all day, you have one eye on the
<br>
fruit, the other on where they're going.&quot;
<br>
<p>Thousands of farmworkers' children - some here legally, many not - grow up
<br>
in Washington's orchard country with minimal supervision while their parents
<br>
bring in the crops. The problem is most acute in summer, when schools run
<br>
limited programs if they're open at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From Wenatchee to Walla Walla, communities are responding with programs,
</em><br>
especially for school-age children too old for day care but too young to
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>But the need far outstrips the care available. Many towns lack the resources
<br>
or political will to help. In communities where programs do exist, lack of
<br>
transportation remains a huge barrier.
<br>
<p>And some believe racism underlies resistance to creating programs for Latino
<br>
children of migrant workers.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why can't they just eat the fruit that has fallen off the trees?&quot; one
<br>
school official in Grant County said to a startled child advocate who was
<br>
pushing for a summer-food program.
<br>
<p>&quot;The power structure often doesn't reflect the makeup of the community in
<br>
this region,&quot; said Laura Strickler of the Children's Alliance, a statewide
<br>
advocacy organization. &quot;You really have to convince them of the need.&quot;
<br>
<p>At the same time, farmworkers - mostly poor, geographically isolated and
<br>
invisible by virtue of their illegal status - can be reluctant to seek help.
<br>
Economic realities often thrust older children into earning money or
<br>
providing child care.
<br>
<p>&quot;There'll be a little 8- or 9-year-old taking care of several younger
<br>
siblings,&quot; said Debbie Sanchez, who oversees a Boys &amp; Girls Club summer
<br>
program in Othello, Adams County. &quot;They're raising themselves.&quot;
<br>
<p>There have been horror stories in Washington this summer - kids drowning in
<br>
irrigation canals, children locked in their rooms while parents worked, a
<br>
3-year-old raped by a neighbor while in the care of an older sibling.
<br>
<p>Last month, a 2-month-old boy died in Othello in the care of a 16-year-old
<br>
girl while his parents worked in an orchard an hour's drive away in Pasco.
<br>
The baby, who had signs of pneumonia, had been to a clinic the night before;
<br>
his parents had planned to bring him to the doctor again the following
<br>
evening.
<br>
<p>But during the day, the girl brought the baby to a hospital, where doctors
<br>
pronounced him dead. It took six hours to find the parents - an orchard
<br>
supervisor initially notified the wrong couple, who showed up in a panic at
<br>
the hospital.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you're a 16-year-old taking care of a 2-month-old, that's a big
<br>
responsibility,&quot; said Leo Gaeta of the Columbia Basin Health Association.
<br>
&quot;You wonder: Could this have been prevented?&quot;
<br>
<p>And catch-as-catch-can child care contributes to longer-term problems: low
<br>
test scores, high rates of dropouts, teen pregnancy and juvenile crime,
<br>
child advocates say.
<br>
<p>&quot;Kids will only dream as far as they can see,&quot; said Ryan Graves, executive
<br>
director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of the Columbia Basin. &quot;Too many of these
<br>
kids see no way out.&quot;
<br>
<p>Needs come into the open
<br>
<p>Two summers ago, when the state opened a tent camp for farmworkers in East
<br>
Wenatchee, it was as if a hidden community was discovered.
<br>
<p>Families once scattered in abandoned trailers, illegal campsites or down
<br>
dirt roads were suddenly visible. Child advocates realized just how many
<br>
kids were living without much supervision.
<br>
<p>With money and a push from state education officials, local officials
<br>
created a summer school and day-care program aimed at the children of cherry
<br>
pickers. It opened before dawn and offered bus service to and from tent
<br>
camps.
<br>
<p>In all, 45 cherry harvesters' children joined about 150 Wenatchee School
<br>
District students. Among them were Navarro's three youngest - Juvenal, 8;
<br>
Jesus, 10; and Carlos, 12.
<br>
<p>&quot;I've been coming here 22 or 23 years now (from California),&quot; she said.
<br>
&quot;I've never had such a great program to put my kids into.&quot;
<br>
<p>Other efforts:
<br>
<p>. A program in Walla Walla run by the nonprofit Center for Sharing serves
<br>
many of the 250 children from a farm-labor housing camp on the edge of town.
<br>
This summer, 45 preschoolers in a migrant Head Start program participated in
<br>
drama, dance and computer classes. A program that includes break-dancing
<br>
lessons draws 120 school-age youth.
<br>
<p>. Some child-care centers adjust their hours to match the harvest. In
<br>
Brewster, Okanogan County, the for-profit Children's House is open from 4
<br>
a.m. to 6:30 p.m. during the cherry harvest. Parents carry the children in
<br>
and lay them on rows of cots to catch a few more hours of sleep. &quot;It's quite
<br>
a sight,&quot; said director Keith Johnson.
<br>
<p>Effort goes into recruiting
<br>
<p>But just because you build it doesn't mean they will come.
<br>
<p>Enrolling the cherry harvesters' children in the Wenatchee program required
<br>
an intensive, face-to-face recruitment effort led by a Spanish-speaking
<br>
couple - Ray Alaniz, who works for the North Central Educational Service
<br>
District, and his wife, Dania, a home visitor for the Wenatchee School
<br>
District.
<br>
<p>Together, they posted fliers in Laundromats, markets and thrift stores. They
<br>
visited tent camps and handed out enrollment forms for state child-care
<br>
vouchers.
<br>
<p>They learned of illegal camps and visited them, too. &quot;They'd tell me about
<br>
their comadre or compadre out there in the hills hiding with their kids. I'd
<br>
say tell me where, and I'll go out to them, and they'd say, `Really? Way out
<br>
there?' &quot; Ray Alaniz laughed.
<br>
<p><p>It is a calling for Alaniz, a former minister. He grew up in a migrant
<br>
family from Texas but lived much of the year in Prosser, Benton County. When
<br>
he was young, his mother put him inside empty apple bins to keep him out of
<br>
harm's way when she worked in the orchards.
<br>
<p>Later, he worked alongside his father picking asparagus in Washington,
<br>
cotton in Texas, beets in Nebraska. Schools would send letters saying the
<br>
children needed to enroll, but his father would respond: &quot;Quién va poner los
<br>
frijoles en la mesa?&quot; (Who is going to put the beans on the table?)
<br>
<p>That background gives Alaniz insight into some families' reluctance to send
<br>
their children to summer programs.
<br>
<p>&quot;One father said, `This country wants to take away my privilege to teach my
<br>
children how to work.' And I said, `Yes, but I give you another privilege -
<br>
to give them the opportunity to decide for themselves whether they want this
<br>
life.' &quot;
<br>
<p>For every child enrolled in the program, Alaniz figures there are at least
<br>
two more he didn't reach or whose parents declined.
<br>
<p>Many parents prefer their school-age children to work alongside them in the
<br>
orchards, despite labor laws that prohibit it. &quot;Education is important, but
<br>
not as important as survival,&quot; Alaniz said.
<br>
<p>And sometimes, it is the kids who resist. Rosa and Ricardo Negrete lived
<br>
this summer in a tent camp operated by Stemilt Growers. Their 12-year-old
<br>
son took the half-hour bus ride from camp to school just two days before he
<br>
decided he didn't want to go anymore.
<br>
<p>He preferred to hang out at the camp and ended up watching several younger
<br>
children there.
<br>
<p>His parents would check in when they could, but they worried about the camp,
<br>
where there were many single men and much drinking.
<br>
<p>Almost too successful
<br>
<p>Still, Alaniz's recruitment efforts have been almost too successful. He and
<br>
a colleague who helped families fill out paperwork for state child-care
<br>
subsidies were told to slow down because program managers weren't sure they
<br>
could afford to find space for all the children they recruited.
<br>
<p>&quot;Teachers would ask, `Where in the world are you finding all these kids?'
<br>
Well, these kids have always been there - we just weren't serving them,&quot;
<br>
Alaniz said.
<br>
<p>He anticipates enrollment will double next summer.
<br>
<p>&quot;Now I know where to find them,&quot; Alaniz said.
<br>
<p>A $7 Slip 'N Slide and some sack lunches are enough to draw 60 children to
<br>
Mattawa's only park one hot afternoon.
<br>
<p>Nowhere is the need for children's programs more pressing than in this tiny
<br>
town, population 2,609, where 96 percent of children live in poverty.
<br>
<p>&quot;There is absolutely nothing in Mattawa for anyone to do,&quot; said Ryan Graves,
<br>
executive director of the Boys &amp; Girls Club of the Columbia Basin. &quot;Bring
<br>
out a soccer ball, and it's a community event.&quot;
<br>
<p>That lament echoes across Central and Eastern Washington. Kids can't legally
<br>
work until they're 14. They're too old for Head Start or many home day-care
<br>
centers.
<br>
<p>An estimated 40,000 5- to 14-year-old children of migrant and seasonal
<br>
farmworkers live in Washington, according to a 2000 report prepared for the
<br>
Migrant Health Program of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
<br>
<p>A study last year by the nonprofit School's Out Washington showed only
<br>
enough licensed child-care slots to serve about 8 percent of all school-aged
<br>
children in Eastern Washington.
<br>
<p>The state spends $9.2 million a year on child-care subsidies for seasonal
<br>
agricultural workers, serving more than 6,400 children last year, about 40
<br>
percent of them school-aged.
<br>
<p>But 1,400 more children had to be turned away because the money ran out,
<br>
according to state officials.
<br>
<p>Mattawa is the newest of five summer food-and-recreation programs launched
<br>
by the Boys &amp; Girls Club in the past three years. Similar programs are open
<br>
in Soap Lake, Moses Lake, Quincy and Othello, which drew 200 children the
<br>
day it opened in 1998.
<br>
<p>Summer school keeps many children busy during the morning hours in July, but
<br>
school closes in the afternoons and for the entire month of August. In
<br>
Mattawa, the Boys &amp; Girls Club opens its program in the park at 1:30 p.m.
<br>
with sack lunches trucked in from Othello, 30 minutes away.
<br>
<p>As in Wenatchee, the creation of a new farmworker-housing project in Mattawa
<br>
two years ago highlighted the needs of the children.
<br>
<p>&quot;We were just not prepared at all,&quot; said Mayor Judy Esser.
<br>
<p>It took three years to find money and an organization willing to run the
<br>
Mattawa program. The Boys &amp; Girls Club took it on with backing from the
<br>
Seattle-based Discuren Charitable Foundation as well as School's Out
<br>
Washington and the Children's Alliance.
<br>
<p>Even so, the Boys &amp; Girls Club lost money on the program this year, and it's
<br>
unclear whether it will continue.
<br>
<p>In desperation, a few growers have started their own programs.
<br>
<p>Cheryl Broetje and her husband, Ralph, run one of the Northwest's largest
<br>
farming enterprises, outside Prescott in Walla Walla County. About 11 years
<br>
ago, they built a farmworker-housing project on their land that is home to
<br>
600 people, including 250 children.
<br>
<p>&quot;We kind of became social workers right away when we built the housing.
<br>
Suddenly, there were all these needs that we never expected,&quot; Cheryl Broetje
<br>
said.
<br>
<p>The Broetjes now operate a private, Christian elementary school; a school
<br>
for older students and programs for troubled youth; a preschool; a
<br>
leadership program for youth; and a summer day camp that serves about 60 5-
<br>
to 12-year-olds.
<br>
<p>Many orchardists and nonprofit organizations tour their farm to look at the
<br>
programs, &quot;but it comes down to dollars, and there just isn't the money in
<br>
agriculture to support this,&quot; Broetje said.
