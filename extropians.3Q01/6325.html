<br>
<p>Chomsky note...
<br>
<p>Just got your message. Quick reaction.
<br>
<p>Today's attacks were major atrocities. In terms of number of victims
<br>
they do not reach the level of many others, for example, Clinton's
<br>
bombing of the Sudan with no credible pretext, destroying half its
<br>
pharmaceutical supplies and probably killing tens of thousands of people
<br>
(no one knows, because the US blocked an inquiry at the UN and no one
<br>
cares to pursue it). Not to speak of much worse cases, which easily come
<br>
to mind. But that this was a horrendous crime is not in doubt. The
<br>
primary victims, as usual, were working people: janitors, secretaries,
<br>
firemen, etc. It is likely to prove to be a crushing blow to
<br>
Palestinians and other poor and oppressed people. It is also likely to
<br>
lead to harsh security controls, with many possible ramifications for
<br>
undermining civil liberties and internal freedom.
<br>
<p>The events reveal, dramatically, the foolishness of ideas about &quot;missile
<br>
defense.&quot; As has been obvious all along, and pointed out repeatedly by
<br>
strategic analysts, if anyone wants to cause immense damage in the US,
<br>
including weapons of mass destruction, they are highly unlikely to
<br>
launch a missile attack, thus guaranteeing their immediate destruction.
<br>
There are innumerable easier ways that are basically unstoppable. But
<br>
today's events will, nonetheless, be used to increase the pressure to
<br>
develop these systems and put them into place. &quot;Defense&quot; is a thin cover
<br>
for plans for militarization of space, and with good PR, even the
<br>
flimsiest arguments will carry some weight among a frightened public.
<br>
In short, the crime is a gift to the hard jingoist right, those who hope
<br>
to use force to control their domains. That is even putting aside the
<br>
likely US actions, and what they will trigger -- possibly more attacks
<br>
like this one, or worse. The prospects ahead are even more ominous than
<br>
they appeared to be before the latest atrocities.
<br>

<br>
<p>Bernie Ward Interview Phyllis Bennis
<br>
<p>Bennis: . . . crisis when we escalate the patterns of more and more and
<br>
more violence.
<br>
<p>Ward: At this point in time most Americans would say how could they
<br>
escalate it, I mean, if you didn't respond militarily, wouldn't that be
<br>
worse than in fact responding?
<br>
<p>Bennis: Well, I think the very worst thing would be responding
<br>
militarily to the wrong country, as the U.S. has been known to do, not
<br>
too long ago, in fact, when it knocked out a vaccine company in the
<br>
Sudan claiming that it was tied to Bin Laden and only six months later
<br>
saying, whoops, I guess we got the wrong place. And in fact, settled
<br>
with the owner of that factory for having destroyed it, not to mention
<br>
destroyed the one factory in central Africa that was producing crucial
<br>
vaccines for children in that impoverished part of the world. So we have
<br>
to be very careful. And yes, I think it would be worse to respond
<br>
militarily than to be cautious and to say let's use this to do what is
<br>
so difficult at a moment like this, when we're horrified by the human
<br>
toll, the human tragedy, to say let's stop for a moment and think about
<br>
why is it that people around the world, so many people, are starting to
<br>
hate symbols of the U.S. as symbols of oppression.
<br>
<p>Ward: Well, now you know that you are in a huge minority tonight when
<br>
you suggest that one of the things we ought to take from this is to ask
<br>
the question of why committed terrorism against the United States to
<br>
begin with, and most Americans are simply going to say, &quot;Who cares?&quot;
<br>
most Americans are going to say, &quot;It was whoever it was and we're going
<br>
to go get them,&quot; and most Americans at least in the polls already that
<br>
have been released, say that our support for Israel is very crucial and
<br>
that, you know, this is just going to solidify . . . you, you are in a
<br>
huge minority when you suggest that part of what happened today might be
<br>
connected to foreign policy decisions that we have made in other parts
<br>
of the world.
<br>
<p>Bennis: But, you know what Bernie, you may be right that I am in a
<br>
minority, but I think these words have to be said. We've had too many
<br>
years of experience of answering these kinds of attacks with more
<br>
violence. And you know what? It hasn't worked. If we're serious about
<br>
ending attacks like this, we have to go to the root causes.
<br>
<p>Ward: And what are the root causes?
<br>
<p>Bennis: To me it's a question of the arrogance of the U.S., the policies
<br>
around the world, not only in the Middle East, although that's obviously
<br>
a big component, but our policies of abandoning international law,
<br>
dissing the United Nations, refusing to sign conventions and
<br>
international treaties that we demand everybody else in the world sign
<br>
on to, whether it's the prohibition against anti-personnel land mines,
<br>
support for the international criminal court, the convention on the
<br>
rights of the child, for God sakes that should be a no-brainer, only the
<br>
U.S. and Somalia have refused that one, you know, when countries around
<br>
the world and people around the world look at this, not to mention the
<br>
most recent stuff about abandoning the Kyoto treaty, threatening to
<br>
throw out the ABM Treaty, that's been the cornerstone of arms control
<br>
for, you know, twenty-five years, they say, &quot;Who is this country? Why do
<br>
they think they're so much better than everybody else in the world just
<br>
because they have a bigger army?&quot;
<br>
<p>Ward: So do we deserve what happened to us today?
<br>
Bennis: No, no one deserves what happened. There's no justification. . .
<br>
<p>Ward: Did we ask for it?
<br>
<p>Bennis: The question is: How do we stop it? The question is how do we
<br>
stop it. And military strikes are not going to stop it.
<br>
Ward: All right. So the example of terrorism certainly is if we look at
<br>
Israel, the example is that when you respond with violence for violence
<br>
it does not stop the terrorism.
<br>
<p>Bennis: Absolutely right.
<br>
<p>Ward: And in fact we saw for the first time yesterday or the day before
<br>
an Arab Israeli citizen who committed a suicide bombing, meaning
<br>
obviously that even buffers between them and the West Bank aren't going
<br>
to make any difference one way or the other.
<br>
Bennis: Right. Ending occupation of the West Bank and Gaza and East
<br>
Jerusalem might make some difference. But certainly what isn't working
<br>
is responding with more violence.
<br>
<p>Ward: But aren't the extremists, Osama Bin Laden has declared war on
<br>
this country, , there's an interesting article in Salon.com about how
<br>
this is a very different kind of terrorism than the terrorism of the
<br>
P.L.O. and Black September and others in the sixties and the seventies
<br>
and the eighties, that they see this as a war of attrition, that if they
<br>
can wear down the American people, if they can get them so worried about
<br>
this that they'll be willing to make compromises. Is it a war? Is that
<br>
an accurate term today?
<br>
Bennis: I don't know if it's a very useful term. Again, we don't know
<br>
that this was Osama Bin Laden having anything to do with the events of
<br>
today. I think that we have to be a little bit cautious when we hear
<br>
U.S. officials and former U.S. officials, as we've been hearing all day
<br>
tonight, talking as if, number one, they knew it was Osama Bin Laden,
<br>
number two, that this is what Henry Kissinger and so many others today
<br>
have said is just like Pearl Harbor and the U.S. should respond . . .
<br>
<p>Ward: Yeah. I don't like that analogy and I can't tell you why I don't
<br>
like it, but I don't like it.
<br>
<p>Bennis: I'll tell you one reason why maybe you don't like it, and it's
<br>
one of the reasons I don't like it either. It's that one of the first
<br>
things the U.S. did after Pearl Harbor was to round up all the
<br>
Japanese-American citizens and put them in concentration camps - in this
<br>
country. Now I hope that that's not what anyone in the U.S. is thinking
<br>
about when they talk about responding the way we did to Pearl Harbor.
<br>
But it's a very dangerous precedent. We've already heard about death
<br>
threats against Arab Americans and Muslim organizations in the U.S. That
<br>
kind of hysteria is already on the rise. And we have to be very cautious
<br>
and conscious about the dangers of that. We have to be very cautious
<br>
when we hear someone like James Baker, the former Secretary of State,
<br>
claiming that he thinks there would be ninety-nine to one hundred
<br>
percent support across the U.S., that's what he said today, for &quot;taking
<br>
out&quot; a person who heads an organization like Bin Laden's and getting rid
<br>
of the legal prohibitions against that.
<br>
<p>Ward: Well, I think that's going to go, to be quite honest with you, I
<br>
think there's going to be legislation maybe even as early as tomorrow to
<br>
eliminate that or get rid of that prohibition against assassinations.
<br>
<p>Bennis: You may be right. But I think that we can guarantee it's not
<br>
going to work. It's not going to stop events like this.
<br>
Ward: Let me put you into a bigger minority.
<br>
Bennis: O.K.
<br>
<p>Ward: Make the case for why the U.S. would be so hated in the Middle
<br>
East.
<br>
<p>Bennis: I think it's hated in the Middle East because, number one, it's
<br>
uncritical support to the tune of between three and five billion dollars
<br>
a year in unconditional support to Israeli occupation, including
<br>
providing the helicopter gunships, the F-16s, the missiles that are
<br>
fired from the gunships, that are used to enforce that occupation. It's
<br>
hated, number two, because it has armed these, these, repressive Arab
<br>
regimes throughout the region, in Saudi Arabia, In Egypt, in Jordan,
<br>
throughout the region, that have suppressed their own people, that have
<br>
taken either oil money or arms to build absolute monarchies in which
<br>
citizens have no rights and where the U.S. claims to support
<br>
democratization of every government in the world, don't seem to apply
<br>
when the U.S. seems to think it's fine when one absolute monarch dies
<br>
and passes on the baton to his son, you see every U.S. official and all
<br>
of their European and other Western allies flocking to the funeral to
<br>
say &quot;The King is dead, long live the new King.&quot; We see it in Saudi
<br>
Arabia, we see it in Morocco, in Jordan, throughout the region. And
<br>
there's enormous resentment of that kind of support. So those two
<br>
sectors alone, support for the Israeli occupation and the arming of
<br>
these repressive Arab regimes is enough. Now that doesn't even get to
<br>
the question of the impact of U.S. imposed sanctions on the civilian
<br>
population of Iraq, the bombing of Iraq, that's been going on for ten
<br>
years now, all of these are things that have dropped off the radar
<br>
screen of the media coverage in the U.S. but are very much front and
<br>
center in Arab consciousness in the region.
<br>
<p>Ward: Would you be surprised if I told you a poll has come out in which
<br>
a very large majority of Americans say they're willing to give up civil
<br>
liberties in order to &quot;fight terrorism,&quot; and that there may be
<br>
legislation introduced in Congress tomorrow to in some cases suspend
<br>
habeas corpus and other things in the cause of fighting terrorism?
<br>
<p>Bennis: Would I be surprised? No. Because I think too many people in
<br>
this country have been misled by politicians and by the media to think
<br>
that somehow that's going to work. That if you have more profiling based
<br>
on race and ethnicity, if you identify Arabs and don't let them on
<br>
planes, if you do what the multi-agency task force in 1987 and 1988
<br>
tried to do, which was to actually round up citizens of seven Arab
<br>
countries plus Iran on a preventive basis and put them in a
<br>
concentration camp in Oakdale, Louisiana. It would not be surprising
<br>
that that's something very much on the minds of policy-makers. It would
<br>
be, I hope you're wrong to say that it would be supported by most people
<br>
in this country, but unfortunately I could understand why it might be
<br>
because of that misleading, what I would call propaganda, that has led
<br>
people to think that somehow that would work, that that would make
<br>
people safer, that if you didn't allow Arabs on the airplanes, somehow
<br>
it would be safe to fly. You know, this is the kind of illusion that is
<br>
bred by racism. And it's a very dangerous tendency in this country. And
<br>
I do hope that we don't have our political leadership in Washington
<br>
tomorrow or next week moving towards this kind of an approach ostensibly
<br>
as a way of providing safety for American citizens.
<br>
<p>Ward: Phyllis Bennis, I really appreciate this. I hope we can keep in
<br>
touch and maybe invite you back on again.
<br>
Bennis: I look forward to it.

<br>
<p>Statement on September 11 Attack
<br>
David McReynolds, WRL
<br>
<p>As we write, Manhattan feels under siege, with all bridges, tunnels, and
<br>
subways closed, and tens of thousands of people walking slowly north
<br>
from Lower Manhattan. As we sit in our offices here at War Resisters
<br>
League, our most immediate thoughts are of the hundreds if not thousands
<br>
of New Yorkers who have lost their lives in the collapse of the World
<br>
Trade Center. The day is clear, the sky is blue, but vast clouds billow
<br>
over the ruins where so many have died, including a great many rescue
<br>
workers who were there when the final collapse occurred.
<br>
<p>Of course we know that our friends and co-workers in Washington, D.C.
<br>
have similar thoughts about the ordinary people who have been trapped in
<br>
the parts of the Pentagon which were also struck by a jet. And we think
<br>
of the innocent passengers on the hi-jacked jets who were carried to
<br>
their doom on this day.
<br>
<p>We do not know at this time from what source the attack came. We do know
<br>
that Yasser Arafat has condemned the bombing. We hesitate to make an
<br>
extended analysis until more information is available but some things
<br>
are clear. For the Bush Administration to talk of spending hundreds of
<br>
billions on Star Wars is clearly the sham it was from the beginning,
<br>
when terrorism can so easily strike through more routine means.
<br>
<p>We urge Congress and George Bush that whatever response or policy the
<br>
U.S. develops it will be clear that this nation will no longer target
<br>
civilians, or accept any policy by any nation which targets civilians.
<br>
This would mean an end to the sanctions against Iraq, which have caused
<br>
the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians. It would mean not only
<br>
a condemnation of terrorism by Palestinians but also the policy of
<br>
assassination against the Palestinian leadership by Israel, and the
<br>
ruthless repression of the Palestinian population and the continuing
<br>
occupation by Israel of the West Bank and Gaza.
<br>
<p>The policies of militarism pursued by the United States have resulted in
<br>
millions of deaths, from the historic tragedy of the Indochina war,
<br>
through the funding of death squads in Central America and Colombia, to
<br>
the sanctions and air strikes against Iraq. This nation is the largest
<br>
supplier of &quot;conventional weapons&quot; in the worldand those weapons fuel
<br>
the starkest kind of terrorism from Indonesia to Africa. The early
<br>
policy support for armed resistance in Afghanistan resulted in the
<br>
victory of the Talibanand the creation of Osama Bin Laden.
<br>
<p>Other nations have also engaged in these policies. We have, in years
<br>
past, condemned the actions of the Russian government in areas such as
<br>
Chechnya, the violence on both sides in the Middle East, and in the
<br>
Balkans. But our nation must take responsibility for its own actions. Up
<br>
until now we have felt safe within our borders. To wake on a clear day
<br>
to find our largest city under siege reminds us that in a violent world,
<br>
none are safe.
<br>
<p>Let us seek an end of the militarism that has characterized this nation
<br>
for decades. Let us seek a world in which security is gained through
<br>
disarmament, international cooperation, and social justice not through
<br>
escalation and retaliation. We condemn without reservation attacks such
<br>
as those which occurred today, which strike at thousands of civiliansmay
<br>
these profound tragedies remind us of the impact U.S. policies have had
<br>
on other civilians in other lands. We also condemn reflexive hostility
<br>
against people of Arab descent living in this country and urge that
<br>
Americans recall the part of our heritage that opposes bigotry in all
<br>
forms.
<br>
<p>We are one world. We shall live in a state of fear and terror or we
<br>
shall move toward a future in which we seek peaceful alternatives to
<br>
violence, and a more just distribution of the world's resources. As we
<br>
mourn the many lives lost, our hearts call out for reconciliation, not
<br>
revenge.

<p><p>--------
<br>
<p><p>Sept 11
<br>
by Robert Jensen
<br>
<p>September 11 was a day of sadness, anger and fear.
<br>
Like everyone in the United States and around the world, I shared the
<br>
deep sadness at the deaths of thousands.
<br>
<p>But as I listened to people around me talk, I realized the anger and
<br>
fear I felt were very different, for my primary anger is directed at the
<br>
leaders of this country and my fear is not only for the safety of
<br>
Americans but for innocents civilians in other countries.
<br>
<p>It should need not be said, but I will say it: The acts of terrorism
<br>
that killed civilians in New York and Washington were reprehensible and
<br>
indefensible; to try to defend them would be to abandon one's humanity.
<br>
No matter what the motivation of the attackers, the method is beyond
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p>But this act was no more despicable as the massive acts of terrorism --
<br>
the deliberate killing of civilians for political purposes -- that the
<br>
U.S. government has committed during my lifetime. For more than five
<br>
decades throughout the Third World, the United States has deliberately
<br>
targeted civilians or engaged in violence so indiscriminate that there
<br>
is no other way to understand it except as terrorism. And it has
<br>
supported similar acts of terrorism by client states.
<br>
<p>If that statement seems outrageous, ask the people of Vietnam. Or
<br>
Cambodia and Laos. Or Indonesia and East Timor. Or Chile. Or Central
<br>
America. Or Iraq, or Palestine. The list of countries and peoples who
<br>
have felt the violence of this country is long. Vietnamese civilians
<br>
bombed by the United States. Timorese civilians killed by a U.S. ally
<br>
with U.S.-supplied weapons. Nicaraguan civilians killed by a U.S. proxy
<br>
army of terrorists. Iraqi civilians killed by the deliberate bombing of
<br>
an entire country's infrastructure.
<br>
<p>So, my anger on this day is directed not only at individuals who
<br>
engineered the Sept. 11 tragedy but at those who have held power in the
<br>
United States and have engineered attacks on civilians every bit as
<br>
tragic. That anger is compounded by hypocritical U.S. officials' talk of
<br>
their commitment to higher ideals, as President Bush proclaimed &quot;our
<br>
resolve for justice and peace.&quot;
<br>
<p>To the president, I can only say: The stilled voices of the millions
<br>
killed in Southeast Asia, in Central America, in the Middle East as a
<br>
direct result of U.S. policy are the evidence of our resolve for justice
<br>
and peace.
<br>
<p>Though that anger stayed with me off and on all day, it quickly gave way
<br>
to fear, but not the fear of &quot;where will the terrorists strike next,&quot;
<br>
which I heard voiced all around me. Instead, I almost immediately had to
<br>
face the question: &quot;When will the United States, without regard for
<br>
civilian casualties, retaliate?&quot; I wish the question were, &quot;Will the
<br>
United States retaliate?&quot; But if history is a guide, it is a question
<br>
only of when and where.
<br>
<p>So, the question is which civilians will be unlucky enough to be in the
<br>
way of the U.S. bombs and missiles that might be unleashed. The last
<br>
time the U.S. responded to terrorism, the attack on its embassies in
<br>
Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, it was innocents in the Sudan and
<br>
Afghanistan who were in the way. We were told that time around they hit
<br>
only military targets, though the target in the Sudan turned out to be a
<br>
pharmaceutical factory.
<br>
<p>As I monitored television during the day, the talk of retaliation was in
<br>
the air; in the voices of some of the national-security &quot;experts&quot; there
<br>
was a hunger for retaliation. Even the journalists couldn't resist;
<br>
speculating on a military strike that might come, Peter Jennings of ABC
<br>
News said that &quot;the response is going to have to be massive&quot; if it is to
<br>
be effective.
<br>
<p>Let us not forget that a &quot;massive response&quot; will kill people, and if the
<br>
pattern of past U.S. actions holds, it will kill innocents. Innocent
<br>
people, just like the ones in the towers in New York and the ones on the
<br>
airplanes that were hijacked. To borrow from President Bush, &quot;mother and
<br>
fathers, friends and neighbors&quot; will surely die in a massive response.
<br>
<p>If we are truly going to claim to be decent people, our tears must flow
<br>
not only for those of our own country. People are people, and grief that
<br>
is limited to those within a specific political boundary denies the
<br>
humanity of others.
<br>
<p>And if we are to be decent people, we all must demand of our government
<br>
-- the government that a great man of peace, Martin Luther King Jr.,
<br>
once described as &quot;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world&quot; --
<br>
that the insanity stop here.

<br>
<p><p>Atrocities may be designed to provoke America into costly military
<br>
adventure
<br>
<p>By Robert Fisk
<br>
12 September 2001
<br>
<p>I can imagine how Osama bin Laden received the news of the atrocities in
<br>
the United States. In all, I must have spent five hours listening to him
<br>
in Sudan and then in the vastness of the Afghan mountains, as he
<br>
described the inevitable collapse of the United States, just as he and
<br>
his comrades in the Afghan war helped to destroy the power of the Red
<br>
Army.
<br>
<p>He will have watched satellite television, he will have sat in the
<br>
corner of his room, brushing his teeth as he always did, with a mishwak
<br>
stick, thinking for up to a minute before speaking; he is one of the few
<br>
Arabs who doesn't feel embarrassed to think before he speaks. He once
<br>
told me with pride how his own men had attacked the Americans in
<br>
Somalia. He acknowledged that he knew personally two of the Saudis
<br>
executed for bombing an American military base in Riyadh. Could he have
<br>
been behind yesterday's mass slaughter in America?
<br>
<p>Of course, we need a health warning here. If Mr bin Laden was really
<br>
guilty of all the things he has been blamed for, he would need an army
<br>
of 10,000. And there is something deeply disturbing about the world's
<br>
habit of turning to the latest hate figure whenever blood is shed. But
<br>
when events of this momentous scale take place, there is a new
<br>
legitimacy in casting one's eyes at those who have constantly threatened
<br>
America.
<br>
<p>Mr bin Laden had a kind of religious experience during the Afghan war. A
<br>
Russian shell had fallen at his feet and, in the seconds as he waited
<br>
for it to explode, he said he had a sudden, religious feeling of
<br>
calmness. The shell  and Americans may come to wish the opposite
<br>
happened  never exploded. The United States must leave the Gulf, he
<br>
would say every 10 minutes. America must stop all sanctions against the
<br>
Iraqi people. America must stop using Israel to oppress Palestinians. It
<br>
was his constant theme, untouched by doubt or the real complexities of
<br>
the Middle East. He was not fighting an anti-colonial war, but a
<br>
religious one. In the Arabia that he would govern, there would be more,
<br>
not less, head chopping, more severe punishments, no Western-style
<br>
democracy.
<br>
<p>His supporters  Algerians, Kuwaitis, Egyptians and Gulf Arabs  would
<br>
gather round him in his tent with the awe of men listening to a messiah.
<br>
I watched them one night in Afghanistan in a mountain camp so cold that
<br>
I woke to find ice in my hair. They were obedient to him, not the kind
<br>
of obedience of schoolchildren but the sort of adherence you find among
<br>
people whose minds are made up. And the words they listened to were
<br>
fearful in their implications. American civilians would no more be
<br>
spared than military targets. This was not a man who would hesitate to
<br>
carry out his promises if he could. He was a man who would have
<br>
appreciated the appalling irony of creating a missile defence shield
<br>
against &quot;rogue states'' but unable to prevent men crashing domestic
<br>
airliners into the centre of America's financial and military power.
<br>
<p>Yet I also remember one night when Mr bin Laden saw a pile of newspapers
<br>
in my bag and seized upon them. By a sputtering oil lamp, he read them
<br>
page by page in the corner of his tent, clearly unaware of the world
<br>
around him, reading aloud of an Iranian Foreign Minister's visit to
<br>
Saudi Arabia. Was this really a man who could damage America, who would
<br>
have laughed when he heard that the United States had placed a $5m
<br>
(£3.3m) reward on his head? Was it not America, I wondered then, which
<br>
was turning Mr bin Laden into the face of &quot;world terror?'' Was he really
<br>
so powerful and so deadly?
<br>
<p>If  and we must keep repeating this word if  the shadow of the Middle
<br>
East falls over yesterday's destruction, then who else in the region
<br>
could produce such meticulously timed assaults on the world's only
<br>
superpower? The rag-tag and corrupt Palestinian nationalist groups that
<br>
used to favour hijacking are unlikely to be able to produce a single
<br>
suicide bomber. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have neither the capability nor
<br>
the money that this assault needed. Perhaps the old satellite groups
<br>
that moved close to the Lebanese Hezbollah in the 1980s, before the
<br>
organisation became a solely resistance movement, could plan something
<br>
like this. The bombing of the US Marines in 1983 needed precision,
<br>
timing and infinite planning. But Iran, which supported these groups,
<br>
has changed out of recognition since then, now more involved in its
<br>
internal struggles than in the long-dead aspiration to &quot;export'' a
<br>
religious revolution. Iraq lies broken, its agents more intent on
<br>
torturing their own people than striking at the country that defeated it
<br>
so suddenly in 1991.
<br>
<p>So the mountains of Afghanistan will be photographed from satellite and
<br>
high-altitude aircraft in the coming days, Mr bin Laden's old training
<br>
camps  and perhaps a few new ones  highlighted on the overhead
<br>
projectors in the Pentagon. But to what end? When America last tried to
<br>
strike at Mr bin Laden, it destroyed an innocent pharmaceuticals plant
<br>
in Sudan and a few of Mr bin Laden's Muslim followers in Afghanistan.
<br>
For if this is a war between the Saudi millionaire and President Bush's
<br>
America, it cannot be fought like other wars. Indeed, can it be fought
<br>
at all without some costly military adventure overseas.
<br>
<p>Or is that what Mr bin Laden seeks above all else?
