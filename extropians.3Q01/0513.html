<em>&gt; Two claims are implicit here; one is that whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these terms refer to, they ought to be replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms that do not derive from traditional religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs.  I find this very persuasive for a variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of reasons, chief among them that it would prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple miscommunication.  (I am opposed to the camp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that says that we can &quot;heal&quot; rifts between science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and religion---or any other substantive struggles---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by being mealy-mouthed in an effort to deceive or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to mollify.)
</em><br>
<p>In further support of your cogent comments, let me add that we need to
<br>
_resolve_ the differences between science and religion. By that I mean we need
<br>
to come to final resolution as to what is accurate and correct versus what is
<br>
inaccurate and incorrect with regard to the differences between the two. I
<br>
feel that resolution rather than reconciliation will defuse the conflict, and
<br>
I feel that way because I have no doubt which side will prevail if honesty and
<br>
pancritical rationalism are judiciously applied.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The second claim is that traditional religious beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are false, and therefore need to be debunked.  Few on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list with argue with that.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I like this list, and feel comfortable here, because of that. I also like
<br>
to inload as much of the convivial cachet of cognitive competence as I can
<br>
manage. Thanks to everyone who contributes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But we are not short of other words that more clearly describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the breaking of moral maxims, certainly not in English anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So one cannot help but suspect that people who wish to use the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;sin&quot; in a serious way have something more on their plate.
</em><br>
<p>I'll say they do! They aren't satisfied with pointing out that someone has
<br>
made a mistake. Oh, no! It has to be much worse than a mere mistake. For
<br>
sinning, you will burn in hell for all eternity! Now, I ask you, what kind of
<br>
sadistic rat bastard makes up crap like that to scare little children?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't really know what it could be, unless, as I said before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pander to people with traditional religious beliefs.  Please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tell me what it is.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that requiring folks to believe idiotic
<br>
religious dogma gives the organized fanatics the upper hand. It immediately
<br>
tosses out reason and replaces it with obedience. Talk about robots! We
<br>
already have 'em. But they're not autonomous robots, they're robots enslaved
<br>
to religiosity and dependent on its authority.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure what this means, except possibly to allege that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; J.R. wants to thoroughly disapprove of something.
</em><br>
<p>I'd say _disprove_, rather than &quot;disapprove&quot; in the case of religiosity.
<br>
Disproving it vindicates ignoring it, and/or deriding it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is for sure true that spirituality has many levels of meaning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's one of the reasons that the term is inherently confusing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now among people whose beliefs are very similar, and so where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little or no confusion is liable to occur, use of the term is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite warranted, of course.  But here, where we would like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine (I hope) just what substance lies behind use of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, I for one want to understand what drives atheists and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialists to ever use it.
</em><br>
<p>I've learned to recognize the use of this term as a way of soft-peddling the
<br>
real and underlying religious beliefs of people who want to insinuate their
<br>
views by way of proselytizing. Whenever I see this word, it sends up a red
<br>
flag to warn me that ulterior agendas and hidden motives are in the
<br>
neighborhood.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That sounds quite admirable, but contains a claim that is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close to an accusation.  It firstly claims that there is some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substance to being &quot;honestly spiritual&quot; or &quot;honestly religious&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even though accepting everything that we learn through science.
</em><br>
<p>It may indicate something more devious. I used to work with a &quot;Mormon&quot; who
<br>
didn't actually believe the nonsense taught by that particular brand of
<br>
theistic demagogy, but he wanted others to think that he did, and more to the
<br>
point, he wanted others to believe in Mormonism! Imagine the advantage that
<br>
would give him if he could pull this off. It's a way of manipulating others so
<br>
that everyone is disarmed of their reason except for the manipulator, who
<br>
privately considers believers weak-minded.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This still needs to be explicated.  The hidden pronouncement is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that atheists/materialists who denigrate religious beliefs (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hence, easily, &quot;religiosity&quot;) are perhaps somewhat crippled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally, or at least lead impoverished lives of some description.
</em><br>
<p>Or the hidden motive may be to make others _feel_ morally diminished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now we total-atheists/materialists---who claim that &quot;spirituality&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;religiousity&quot; do not describe us well---should be treated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as adults who are quite capable of owning up to actual shortcomings;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it is incumbent upon those who think that we are lacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to be very explicit.  If you're right, we can handle it.
</em><br>
<p>I'd add that their position is that unbelievers should be dealt with more
<br>
severely, since, as the Conquistadors have demonstrated, unbelivers have no
<br>
&quot;souls.&quot; This justifies their double standard and provides them with a
<br>
tribalistic bond, plus allowing them to exploit, rob, and murder unbelievers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I've argued with a very close friend for literally decades
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about this issue of religiousity.  He claims, as several here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have, to be spiritual.  He is not as ready as J. R. Malloy or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself (or Robert Ingersoll) to speak up about the falseness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of traditional religous beliefs.  A number of famous people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have claimed to be &quot;religious&quot;, where I just cannot see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applicability of the term---so this is a familiar conundrum.
</em><br>
<p>It's a favorite ploy of sociopaths to pretend religious belief.
<br>
Remember Rasputin? A pope in wolve's clothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay, so this discussion has gone on ever since Darwin, at least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect.  Perhaps there is not only a gene for religiousity,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but a separate gene that causes one to find the terms &quot;religious&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and &quot;spiritual&quot; appealing, and causes one to wish very strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to apply them to oneself regardless of one's actual beliefs?
</em><br>
<p>Sure, one can compare it to initiation into a club or tribe. Doesn't matter if
<br>
you truly believe in the silly mythology of the group, you learn it to become
<br>
a member in good standing. That might help to explain why scientific
<br>
associations are relatively loosely structured (compared to political
<br>
organizations and organized religions) and more akin to labor unions in their
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm being only half-serious, of course, but it indicates my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desperation here to find out what is going on.  My friend came
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to admit that he and I did not differ substantially in either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our experiences or our beliefs.  So after all that time, I still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; came away perplexed as to why atheists/materialists sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employ those terms to describe themselves.  Perhaps one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who so do use the terms could think long and carefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and help us understand why.
</em><br>
<p>That's a superb suggestion, and it carries a little catch-22. By confessing
<br>
the _reasons_ for describing themselves as &quot;spiritual&quot; (instead of as true
<br>
believers in religiosity) they'd unmask themselves, and guess what... they'd
<br>
effectively be admitting that it's just a ruse. So don't expect any takers.
<br>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
