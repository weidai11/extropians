As the Boundaries of Reality Expand, Our Thinking Seems to Be Going Over the
<br>
Edge
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Giacomo Marchesi - for The Washington Post)
<br>
<p>By Joel Garreau
<br>
Washington Post Staff Writer
<br>
Monday, July 23, 2001; Page C01
<br>
<p>Humans are actually a slave race created 200,000 years ago to mine
<br>
monoatomic gold that creates exotic powers for alien beings from a 10th
<br>
planet, the overlords of which are now remembered by mankind as ancient
<br>
Sumerian, Babylonian, Egyptian and Hebrew gods.
<br>
<p>So contended one Neil Freer on May 24 at the Arlington Institute, after its
<br>
president, John Peterson, had told his audience, conspicuously including
<br>
uniformed U.S. military officers, that Freer's presentation might change
<br>
their lives. The institute advises on planning for the future. Its respected
<br>
client list includes the U.S. Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard.
<br>
<p>Or: The government is using black holes to park stealth space weapons
<br>
platforms several galaxies away. This connects to a government program to
<br>
use clairvoyants to sense alien presence on the far side of the moon. So
<br>
suggested the May 22 &quot;Islands in the Clickstream&quot; column of
<br>
technology-and-society consultant Richard Thieme of Milwaukee. Thieme is a
<br>
solid enough citizen that his clients have included Arthur Andersen,
<br>
Allstate Insurance and the Department of the Treasury.
<br>
<p>Have we entered an era in which mind-sizzling technological leaps -- virtual
<br>
reality, genetically altered rabbits that glow in the dark, digital actors,
<br>
laboratory animals bred to grow human organs, stock-trading in your back
<br>
yard, clones -- are now so common that even respected members of the
<br>
scientific world are finding it increasingly difficult to separate miracles,
<br>
magic, myths and madness?
<br>
<p>When that question was put to Kevin Kelly, executive editor of Wired
<br>
magazine when it was the bible of the digerati, he replied, &quot;Well, you know,
<br>
I completely believe in Sasquatch and Bigfoot.&quot;
<br>
<p>- - -
<br>
<p>&quot;There is no use in trying,&quot; said Alice; &quot;one can't believe impossible
<br>
things.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I dare say you haven't had much practice,&quot; said the Queen. &quot;When I was your
<br>
age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as
<br>
many as six impossible things before breakfast.&quot;
<br>
<p>-- Lewis Carroll, &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot;
<br>
<p>- - -
<br>
<p>It's tough to compare one era's stock of ooga-booga with another's. In the
<br>
1200s, scholars researched the size, shape and precise location of Hell, as
<br>
well as how many angels could fit on the head of a pin.
<br>
<p>Today's supply of woo-woo is certainly remarkable, however. At no time in
<br>
human history has scientific rationality so thoroughly underpinned our
<br>
society and the world's economy. As many as 90 percent of all the scientists
<br>
who have ever lived are alive today, science historian Derek John De Solla
<br>
Price once calculated.
<br>
<p>In the past four decades, we have created more scientific knowledge than in
<br>
the previous 5,000 years, by some reckonings -- and we've largely amassed it
<br>
by obeying the First Law of High Tech: Think outside the box.
<br>
<p>Is it possible that in recent years we've thought outside the box so often
<br>
that we forget why we ever thought it was a good idea to have a box at
<br>
all -- a reality model? Is one person's beliefs about what is real as good
<br>
as another's, and it's impolite to argue otherwise? Where do we draw the
<br>
line? Has reality simply become a matter of taste?
<br>
<p>Recently Caroline Wagner, a senior policy analyst with the Science and
<br>
Technology Policy Institute of the Rand Corp. in Arlington, found herself in
<br>
a cafe in Paris, talking into a piece of plastic.
<br>
<p>&quot;I could not conceptualize how I could talk instantly with my husband in
<br>
Virginia while I was sitting on the Champs-Elysees,&quot; she said of her cell
<br>
phone. &quot;I realized that I just didn't really understand how it worked. I
<br>
knew the physics of it, but when I try to really imagine it working, I
<br>
can't, basically. I just have to accept the 'magic' of it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Magic! The ultimate dirty word, to those who count on reality being
<br>
concrete.
<br>
<p>Yet rational, fact-based projections into the near future are
<br>
indistinguishable from science fiction. Steven Spielberg's new film, &quot;A.I.,&quot;
<br>
is based on the work of scientists like Ray Kurzweil, who has nine honorary
<br>
doctorates, has been awarded honors by two U.S. presidents, and was named
<br>
inventor of the year by MIT. He projects that machines will transcend mortal
<br>
brainpower within 20 years.
<br>
<p>The paranormal and the otherworldly are a boom industry. This summer's crop
<br>
of films includes &quot;Tomb Raiders,&quot; &quot;Atlantis: The Lost Empire,&quot; &quot;Final
<br>
Fantasy: The Spirits Within,&quot; &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Ghost World,&quot; &quot;Ghosts
<br>
of Mars,&quot; &quot;Soul Survivors&quot; and &quot;Jeepers Creepers.&quot; In &quot;Shrek&quot; the bad guy
<br>
attempts to banish fairy tale characters and magical creatures to make a
<br>
perfect kingdom, and we're not on his side, educated as we may be.
<br>
<p>Art Bell's national radio show, dedicated to the spooky, the conspiratorial
<br>
and the alien, broadcast from a bunker in the Nevada desert, owns late-night
<br>
radio with 10 million listeners on more than 460 stations.
<br>
<p>Television is loaded with witches, vampires, angels and extraterrestrials,
<br>
from Buffy and Sabrina to &quot;3rd Rock From the Sun&quot; and &quot;The X-Files.&quot;
<br>
<p>The eight-volume apocalyptic fiction series &quot;Left Behind&quot; -- in which the
<br>
Book of Revelation is made into a thriller -- has sold 40 million books.
<br>
Amazon.com gives a respectful review to &quot;The Biggest Secret,&quot; by British
<br>
author David Icke, who believes George Bush and Al Gore are alien lizards.
<br>
<p>On the Internet, Crank Dot Net is &quot;devoted to presenting Web sites by and
<br>
about cranks, crankism, crankishness, and crankosity. All cranks, all the
<br>
time.&quot; Its index alone is a thrilling catalogue of today's belief systems,
<br>
from alien abductions to zero-point energy. Tasty categories include
<br>
alchemy, antigravity, Area 51, Atlantis, Bible code, conspiracy, crop
<br>
circles, Einstein was wrong, hollow Earth, Holocaust deniers, Martians,
<br>
Nostradamus, proof of God, Roswell, N.M., and its imprisoned aliens, sacred
<br>
geometry, satanism, scientific creationism, Scientology, star drives, time
<br>
travel, and urine therapy.
<br>
<p>Where do you draw the line between the marvelous and the lunatic? And if you
<br>
can't agree on something as basic as that, how do all the pieces of society
<br>
work together?
<br>
<p>- - -
<br>
<p>Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
<br>
<p>-- The late astronomer Carl Sagan, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, author of
<br>
&quot;Cosmos&quot; -- the best-selling science book in the history of the English
<br>
language -- and believer in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and
<br>
intelligence.
<br>
<p>- - -
<br>
<p>There are time-honored ways to weed out ideas about alien invaders from the
<br>
planet Nibiru, says Robert Ehrlich, the physics professor at George Mason
<br>
University and author of the recent &quot;Nine Crazy Ideas in Science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ehrlich acknowledges that he is way out on a limb as a scientist in that he
<br>
can imagine how a particle called a tachyon might travel faster than light,
<br>
despite everything Einstein said. He also believes that time travel is not
<br>
out of the question.
<br>
<p>Nonetheless, he contends you can make some reasonable attacks on extravagant
<br>
claims.
<br>
<p>For example, he says, you can locate in the realm of the faith-based any
<br>
ideas that cannot be tested or proved false -- like the notion that the
<br>
world is only 5,000 years old but was created to look as if it were 4.5
<br>
billion years old.
<br>
<p>Obsessiveness rings his bells. &quot;A key indicator here is the proposer's
<br>
selectivity in paying great attention to facts that may support the idea,
<br>
but paying scant attention to facts that refute it.&quot; He puts cold fusion in
<br>
this category.
<br>
<p>Overambitiousness: &quot;A theory of everything that cannot actually calculate
<br>
anything, or make definitive predictions that allow it to be tested, does
<br>
not seem very promising,&quot; he says. Rupert Sheldrake's notion of &quot;morphic
<br>
resonance,&quot; which holds that everything from crystals to human society
<br>
inherit a collective memory, is his example.
<br>
<p>Secrecy among researchers, he says, creates &quot;the impression that they have
<br>
something to hide, and would prefer that others not try to replicate their
<br>
results.&quot;
<br>
<p>Simplicity, on the other hand, he admires. All things being equal, he'll
<br>
always default to the most elegant and spare explanation -- like E=mc{+2} --
<br>
that fits the observable. This principle of choosing the simplest solution
<br>
has been known since the Middle Ages as &quot;Occam's razor,&quot; after a Franciscan
<br>
thinker named William of Ockham.
<br>
<p>A useful way to look at a proposition is to consider its consequences. It's
<br>
not good to believe that antigravity shields will allow you to step out of a
<br>
26th-story window, for example, while the consequences of being wrong can be
<br>
so dramatic.
<br>
<p>The blurring of the line between genius and madness, or science and
<br>
superstition, supports a small book industry all its own. These works
<br>
include &quot;Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud,&quot; by the
<br>
University of Maryland's Robert L. Park, and &quot;The Borderlands of Science:
<br>
Where Sense Meets Nonsense&quot; and &quot;Why People Believe Weird Things:
<br>
Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time&quot; by Michael
<br>
Shermer, editor in chief of Skeptic magazine. There is even &quot;The Complete
<br>
Idiot's Guide to Urban Legends.&quot;
<br>
<p>The thinking that underpins conventional descriptions of reality is hardly
<br>
secret. &quot;It's pretty widely publicized,&quot; says Shermer, a leading scourge of
<br>
superstition and bad science. &quot;There's lot of popular science writing and TV
<br>
shows. It's not a mystery.&quot;
<br>
<p>So what's going on?
<br>
<p>&quot;lt goes to the heart of why religion is still so hugely popular even in
<br>
this age of science,&quot; says Shermer. &quot;At the start of the 20th century,
<br>
sociologists said religiosity would decline because of public education and
<br>
rise of science. Instead, it got bigger. All of this stuff is linked to the
<br>
desire for there to be Something Else with a capital S. A force or a power.
<br>
It's the basis of mythology -- all that Joseph Campbell 'Power of Myth'
<br>
stuff. We love all that. That's why 'Star Wars' and the Force were so
<br>
popular.&quot;
<br>
<p>Why is that appealing?
<br>
<p>&quot;Humans are pattern-seeking storytelling animals trying to make sense of our
<br>
world. And it seems that weird forces surround us. This desire to believe
<br>
goes way back in evolutionary history.&quot;
<br>
<p>Think of the constellations in the night sky. Humans eagerly connect dots
<br>
and then come up with the most elaborate -- even poetic -- tales to imbue
<br>
them with meaning.
<br>
<p>After all, lots of theories have gone from mad to mainstream -- the Earth
<br>
revolves around the sun, or man can fly, or continents drift about on
<br>
tectonic plates, or quantum physics can wrap everything tangible in ideas
<br>
like &quot;quarks&quot; and &quot;charm.&quot; As the physicist Niels Bohr remarked, 'Anyone who
<br>
is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it.&quot; He also said, &quot;You
<br>
never understand quantum physics, you just get used to it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nowadays, you might say, we're so used to not being used to things that it's
<br>
easy to be used to anything.
<br>
<p>Even respectable, mainstream scientists whose theories are totally inside
<br>
the box sound outside the box to a lot of people.
<br>
<p>The expanding universe is accelerating because of a mysterious
<br>
anti-gravitational force. Mars rocks may have life forms; and why not, since
<br>
bacteria two miles deep in stone turn out to be alive.
<br>
<p>Even undergraduates can now conduct experiments in which an electron is in
<br>
two places at once. Matter is made up of superstrings vibrating in as many
<br>
as 13 dimensions. Modern cosmology discusses multiple universes, and
<br>
universes that beget universes.
<br>
<p>Betty Sue Flowers, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, says:
<br>
&quot;The Enlightenment, the Renaissance gave us a sense of coherence. There was
<br>
a benevolent God that invented the universe, even if it were a clockwork
<br>
frame. That framework has been up for grabs -- it has fallen away. For a
<br>
long time it didn't bother us. But now we are facing strong questions.
<br>
Should we indeed ban the cloning of humans? For that you need a larger
<br>
frame. We do not have that agreed-upon larger frame. This is a spiritual
<br>
crisis. It's not about science.&quot;
<br>
<p>- - -
<br>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
<br>
<p>-- Arthur C. Clarke, author of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;
<br>
<p>- - -
<br>
<p>Flowers, who teaches poetry, was the editor of &quot;The Power of Myth,&quot; the book
<br>
by Joseph Campbell with Bill Moyers that accompanied the hugely popular and
<br>
honored PBS series of the same name. She points out the differences between
<br>
religion and science: &quot;The rules for thinking in science mean that no matter
<br>
how weird your idea, you can follow your weirdness and disprove it or come
<br>
up with a better weirdness. If you do, everybody else will drop the old
<br>
weirdness. That's the distinguishing aspect of science. You can convince
<br>
people to drop the weirdness they're holding. Religious weirdness, there's
<br>
no way to get rid of it except to go to war.&quot;
<br>
<p>Flowers sees a cultural revolution coming that seeks to address today's
<br>
confusions about how things really do fit together. She says: &quot;What's
<br>
emerging is an interesting amalgam. It comes from our economic myths, of
<br>
globalization, that everything fits together. And that overlays our
<br>
environmental work about the way things fit together. Even if it's a remote
<br>
snail, it has intrinsic value. There is an interconnectedness of things.
<br>
There is a value somehow in the way things are connected -- the web of life.
<br>
That's the next enlightenment.&quot; She can imagine our interest in the way
<br>
things fit together being expressed in an increased interest in beauty.
<br>
<p>The importance of creating such a commonly held framework, Flowers believes,
<br>
is &quot;it synchronizes human activity. It distinguishes what 'outside the box'
<br>
is. It gives you a way to move forward together.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ray Kurzweil thinks he sees where scientific rationality and our apparently
<br>
inbred need for transcendence can reconcile -- can fit together in a way
<br>
that would help us come up with a new frame. He sees the rise of intelligent
<br>
machines that will not only raise astounding questions about what
<br>
constitutes reality, but perhaps will also help us resolve some.
<br>
<p>Kurzweil is credited with creating not only the first commercial computer
<br>
scanner but also the first machines that could read books out loud to the
<br>
blind. His latest book is called &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines: When
<br>
Computers Exceed Human Intelligence.&quot;
<br>
<p>He accepts and assumes that our world is being transformed at an exponential
<br>
rate by technology, but he sees in that a beauty, a kind of art.
<br>
<p>&quot;I always thought of technology as magical,&quot; he says. &quot;It's about
<br>
transcendence. If you put materials or sounds or colors in a certain
<br>
pattern, the power of it becomes greater than just the materials that go
<br>
into it. That's true of art, music and technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>He is convinced that humans and the intelligent machines we are creating are
<br>
coming together. Within 10 years, he believes, when a thousand-dollar
<br>
personal computer can perform a trillion calculations a second and can be
<br>
embedded in clothing, most routine business transactions, like sales and
<br>
travel reservations, will take place between a human and a machine
<br>
personality that looks like a human face and has pretty good powers of
<br>
spontaneous speech.
<br>
<p>&quot;In my view, human civilization will come to accept that there's not much
<br>
difference between information processing in biological brains or
<br>
non-biological,&quot; Kurzweil says. &quot;That's a political prediction.&quot;
<br>
<p>He adds: &quot;By 2030, 2040, non-biological forms of thinking will become
<br>
dominant.
<br>
<p>We will encounter entities that are not biological that will claim really
<br>
very convincingly to be conscious. How can we resolve that? Our
<br>
consciousness is the most important aspect of reality. We will be doing a
<br>
lot of things that only exist in the mystical world today. Where mystical
<br>
beliefs impinge on our direct observations, people see angels.
<br>
<p>Go back through history and the beliefs in angels, gods and goddesses have
<br>
deep roots.&quot;
<br>
<p>Are you saying that any sufficiently advanced technology is
<br>
indistinguishable from angels?
<br>
<p>&quot;Depends what you mean by angels,&quot; he says.
