Could apes ever rule over man? Frans de Waal, a leading primatologist, argues
<br>
that Planet of the Apes is not just science fiction - we are more like our
<br>
hairy cousins than we dare admit
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/08/05/stirevnws01001.html">http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/08/05/stirevnws01001.html</a>
<br>
<p>Welcome to Earth, some time in the not-sodistant future. The planet has grown
<br>
into a primordial world of jungle, swamp and forest, navigable only by a mesh
<br>
of long swinging vines and moss-ridden branches. Deep in the forest, thick
<br>
vegetation breaks open to reveal a large walled city. It is fortified by ranks
<br>
of armed soldiers and inside is a maze of caves and tree houses sheltering its
<br>
thousands of inhabitants.
<br>
<p>Lying on silk-draped four-poster beds, eating around oak dining tables and
<br>
lining the torch-lit streets of this city are apes: gorillas, baboons, chimps,
<br>
from children to 300lb adults. Primates rule the city and the planet.
<br>
<p>Exiled to the margins, living in makeshift colonies in the mountains, are what
<br>
remains of the human race. Flushed from their hiding places and run out of the
<br>
forest by the physically and mentally superior apes, the humans are regularly
<br>
herded into caged vehicles and transported back to the city to be sold as
<br>
slaves.
<br>
<p>But there is dissent among the ruling primate ranks. The senator apes want the
<br>
humans to be treated with more tolerance and kindness, they want them to have
<br>
a place on the planet in which they can coexist with the master ape race. The
<br>
military, however, do not agree. Humans are a lesser race, they insist: they
<br>
stink, they are uncivilised and their foul presence threatens to overrun the
<br>
planet. They must be rounded up and destroyed.
<br>
<p>Pierre Boulle, of course, was the first to imagine such a world in his classic
<br>
novel Planet of the Apes. The scenario has become one of the most recognised
<br>
and provocative concepts in science fiction. But could it happen? Do apes
<br>
possess the characteristics necessary to become Earth's ruling primates? What
<br>
is the scientific evidence?
<br>
<p>Could apes ever rule over man?
<br>
<p>I don't think I have ever heard of a sadder miscalculation of human potential
<br>
than the Austrian artist who wanted to paint like an ape - except for the guy
<br>
who bungee-jumped with a cord that was two metres too long.
<br>
<p>In 1979 Arnulf Rainer set out to copy each and every brush stroke of a
<br>
painting chimpanzee. Squatting next to the ape, he hoped to produce works of
<br>
the same clarity and intensity. The human painter, however, believed apes to
<br>
be wild, uncontrolled creatures. As a result, he painted the way that he
<br>
thought his fellow primate would paint, becoming more and more agitated
<br>
(banging the paper, spitting on it) until the chimp put a stop to all this
<br>
nonsense by chasing him round the room.
<br>
<p>Without the owner's intervention, the human painter might have learnt that an
<br>
ape has the muscular strength of several grown men bundled into one - which
<br>
explains why it takes them no effort at all to charge a painting with energy.
<br>
<p>Anyone interested in the &quot;cultural&quot; expressions of humans and apes, and how
<br>
they stack up against each other, will be delighted by Boulle's Planet of the
<br>
Apes and the movies it has inspired. Here we have a topsy-turvy world in which
<br>
the apes are superior and we poor humans do everything to prove that we are
<br>
smart, that we deserve good treatment at the hands of our hairy rulers.
<br>
<p>Don't be confused about them: they are definitely apes, not monkeys. The great
<br>
apes are tail-less, broad-shouldered, flat-chested large primates of which
<br>
there are only four species: gorillas, orang-utans, chimpanzees and bonobos.
<br>
We are actually the fifth - it is only the fragility of the human ego which
<br>
keeps biologists from pressing this point.
<br>
<p>But could apes, or should I say the other apes, ever rule a planet? And would
<br>
I - a primate expert and avowed ape-lover - want to live in such a world? Even
<br>
though these are definitely not the kind of questions to which primatologists
<br>
devote symposiums and conferences, we do have opinions. Partly because we hold
<br>
apes in much higher esteem intellectually than most people, we are unshocked
<br>
by the idea that they may have their own social traditions, power struggles
<br>
and petty jealousies. To us, this part of the story is not fiction or even
<br>
science fiction, but plain reality.
<br>
<p>I have studied the way angry young male chimpanzees - endowed with an enormous
<br>
&quot;will to power&quot;, as Nietzsche called it - swaggeringly challenge the system.
<br>
They make friends with other malcontents, rattle the confidence of the
<br>
established leader and ruthlessly knock him off his pedestal when the time
<br>
comes. Meanwhile, the alpha males have their counterstrategies, such as
<br>
systematically disrupting any grooming between rivals who together could pose
<br>
a threat to the existing order. To all intents and purposes, they are nipping
<br>
conspiracies in the bud, punishing each and every transgressor until they
<br>
grovel in the dust.
<br>
<p>Frans de Waal with two grooming macaques
<br>
<p>I had to resort to the writings of Machiavelli to understand their
<br>
divide-and-rule tactics and became so impressed that I am not convinced that a
<br>
human player would fare any better in these power configurations than the
<br>
average chimpanzee.
<br>
<p>This is not because we are not smarter, but because the intelligence that goes
<br>
into this kind of manoeuvring is so basic - having to do with which friends to
<br>
make, which physical risks to take and how to divvy up the spoils - that I am
<br>
not sure our bigger brains would be of much help. A great tactician does not
<br>
need to be a rocket scientist. In addition, any human intelligence advantage
<br>
would be offset by our inferior physical strength: I would rather fight a
<br>
chimpanzee alpha male alongside a couple of ape buddies than with the backing
<br>
of three times as many human friends.
<br>
<p>That is, so long as we do battle without weapons. As soon as technology comes
<br>
into play, we do need rocket scientists and humans are unsurpassed. Apes use
<br>
sticks and stones, sometimes quite effectively - in the field, they have been
<br>
seen to club young leopards to death - but the making of arrow points, spears,
<br>
bows and arrows are all beyond their capabilities. Here we do have some
<br>
serious advantages: greater intelligence and more effective transmission of
<br>
knowledge.
<br>
<p>But note that these differences are gradual. This is what makes Planet of the
<br>
Apes so compelling. It does not assume any ape behaviour for which there isn't
<br>
at least a grain of evidence, and thus justifiably breaks down the barrier
<br>
between human and animal. Having just written a book about this barrier and
<br>
about how it is a typically western preoccupation, I sympathise with the
<br>
depiction of apes as cultural creatures.
<br>
<p>In The Ape and the Sushi Master, I follow the trajectory of the discovery of
<br>
culture in other animals, beginning in the 1950s with Kinji Imanishi and his
<br>
Japanese school of primatology. If culture is defined by socially (as opposed
<br>
to genetically) transmitted habits and knowledge, so that one group may
<br>
develop quite different ways of doing things from another group of the same
<br>
species, it is widespread indeed. The idea is taking the field of animal
<br>
behaviour by storm.
<br>
<p>One community of chimpanzees may crack nuts between hammer and anvil stones,
<br>
whereas another community has plentiful nuts and stones but fails to do
<br>
anything with them. Such invented habits may well endure in a population for
<br>
thousands of years, but their establishment can also be rapid, far more rapid
<br>
at any rate than genetic evolution.
<br>
<p>The great advantages of culture are speed and flexibility. Last year, for
<br>
example, male humpback whales off the Australian coast en masse adopted a new
<br>
song learnt from a group of visitors from the Indian ocean, all in order to
<br>
attract females.
<br>
<p>The way behaviour is copied from others is interesting and for this we
<br>
sometimes use the sushi master comparison. Sushi masters have apprentices who
<br>
slave in the kitchen, mop the floor, bow to the clients, fetch ingredients and
<br>
in the meantime follow from the corners of their eyes, without ever asking a
<br>
question, everything their master is doing.
<br>
<p>For three years they watch: an extreme case of exposure without practice. They
<br>
are waiting for the day when they will be invited to make their first sushi,
<br>
which they will do with remarkable dexterity. It is believed that this is the
<br>
same way - no reward or punishment, no formal instruction - that young
<br>
primates absorb the many cultural practices around them.
<br>
<p>Learning from others is so second nature to us that there is a danger in
<br>
putting young humans and apes together: the direction of influence is more
<br>
likely to be from the ape to the child than the other way around. This was
<br>
discovered the hard way in the 1930s by Winthrop and Luella Kellogg, who were
<br>
forced to terminate a co-rearing experiment in their home when their son
<br>
Donald began to give guttural food barks like those of the female chimpanzee
<br>
Gua with whom he was being raised. When Donald ran to his parents while
<br>
grunting &quot;uhuh, uhuh&quot;, it was decided that his aping of the ape had gone far
<br>
enough.
<br>
<p>Helena Bonham-Carter in Planet of the Apes
<br>
<p>However, the ape, too, proved to be an excellent imitator. The Kelloggs
<br>
describe how she became a typist after having seen her foster parents type for
<br>
many months. Gua would climb on the typewriter stool and sit properly behind
<br>
the machine, moving her hands simultaneously up and down the keyboard,
<br>
pounding the keys with her fingers. We can only speculate about the literary
<br>
heights the chimpanzee might have attained had the experiment continued.
<br>
<p>Some people have questioned my idea of culture. The term evokes images of art
<br>
and classical music, symbols and language, and a heritage which needs
<br>
protection against a mass-consumption society. A so-called cultured person has
<br>
achieved a refinement of tastes, a well developed intellect and a particular
<br>
set of values. This is not how scientists use &quot;culture&quot; in relation to
<br>
animals.
<br>
<p>Culture simply means that knowledge and habits are acquired from others -
<br>
often from the older generation, which explains why two groups of the same
<br>
species may act differently. Thus eating fish and chips, as the British do, or
<br>
singing in groups holding enormous glasses of beer, as the Germans do, are
<br>
both perfect examples of culture.
<br>
<p>I also wonder what harm there can be in exploring non-human parallels of
<br>
culture. Are we happy only with a day-and-night difference, in which we have
<br>
it all and other animals have nothing? Imagine that we were to define &quot;eating&quot;
<br>
by the use of knife and fork. Such a definition would allow us to claim eating
<br>
as uniquely human, even uniquely western, yet we would accomplish this
<br>
distinction by confusing the instruments of consumption with its essence. The
<br>
essence of eating is to get food into one's stomach and in this regard we are
<br>
obviously not special at all.
<br>
<p>The relevant question in relation to culture, therefore, is: what is its
<br>
essence? What is the least common denominator of all things called cultural?
<br>
In my view, this can be only the non-genetic spreading of habits and
<br>
information. The rest is embellishment. Those who have elevated language,
<br>
education, values and other typically human aspects of culture to its defining
<br>
criteria confuse the knives and forks of the process with its essence.
<br>
<p>If apes (and some other animals) have indeed crossed the nature-culture divide
<br>
and have entered a realm that we thought was uniquely ours, this makes their
<br>
movie portrayal as the rulers of the planet a little less of a stretch. But
<br>
why do they need to be so aggressive? Is it because we are, and the script
<br>
turns everything upside down, thus presenting the apes just as ill-behaved as
<br>
us? Or is it because we like to depict apes as animals, hence as brutal and
<br>
uncivilised?
<br>
<p>There is a long tradition of blaming our negative characteristics on the
<br>
animal side of human nature. Thus, when people rampage and kill, they are said
<br>
to act like animals. For our noble traits, on the other hand, we have an
<br>
entirely different story. Our cultures and religions happily take credit,
<br>
claiming that we developed and cultivated these traits by ourselves. We even
<br>
call kind and generous behaviour &quot;humane&quot;, which eliminates any confusion
<br>
about where we got it.
<br>
<p>In this rather black and white view, it is logical to depict apes as
<br>
uncivilised monsters and to emphasise their aggressiveness. The truth, though,
<br>
is that apes, just as humans, can be both. They can be extremely violent,
<br>
killing each other over territory and females, but they can also show sympathy
<br>
and care.
<br>
<p>They share food with each other, defend the weak against the strong and offer
<br>
consolation to distressed individuals, putting an arm around the shoulder of a
<br>
screaming victim of attack, sitting with them till they calm down. I have done
<br>
experiments to see how they keep favours in mind and repay one good deed with
<br>
another, thus building a simple market place of services. My conclusion is
<br>
that in all regards, apes are like us, not just on the negative but also on
<br>
the positive side.
<br>
<p>However, I am talking only of chimpanzees, the apes with the most aggressive
<br>
reputation. You should see the bonobo, their hedonistic sibling species.
<br>
Bonobos resolve conflicts with sex and are far more peaceable than the other
<br>
apes. A totally different planet would have resulted, one called bonoboland in
<br>
which females dominate males, in which homosexual acts are perfectly normal
<br>
and in which xenophobia and domination are replaced by mingling and
<br>
coexistence.
<br>
<p>Preciously little was known about these hippies of the primate world when
<br>
Boulle wrote his book, but I bet that the author, a Frenchman, would not have
<br>
been able to resist the enrichment of his plot that bonobos would have
<br>
provided.
<br>
<p>So there you have it: the mixed reflections of a primate expert on a movie
<br>
that stereotypes his favourite animals while at the same time challenging us
<br>
to imagine a world dominated by them. Not only this, but the movie also
<br>
presents us with the interesting dilemma that it is difficult to prove that
<br>
you are anything other than ridiculous, anything other than a dumb brute, if
<br>
your audience does not want to see you this way.
<br>
<p>Art imitating life: zoo chimpanzees that watch television and paint
<br>
<p>This is a familiar dilemma for those of us who think there is nothing
<br>
inherently funny about apes, that the only reason we laugh about them is
<br>
because we wish to keep them at arm's length. And laugh we do, as exemplified
<br>
by special occasions set up for such fun. Ape dinner parties became standard
<br>
at zoos and menageries in the 19th century and we still see the equivalent on
<br>
television. In the United States there is an entire Chimp Channel devoted to
<br>
dressed-up apes trained to move their mouths frantically while an audio track
<br>
with human speech gives the impression that they are talking.
<br>
<p>The goal is to project the image of animals doing their best to be like us,
<br>
yet failing miserably. They have to fail, because if they become too good at
<br>
eating with cutlery (a sure sign of civilisation), the scene immediately turns
<br>
threatening. As explained by Ramona and Desmond Morris, this cannot be
<br>
tolerated: &quot;In the late 1920s the London Zoo started to organise these
<br>
demonstrations on a regular basis. Each afternoon at a set time a group of
<br>
young chimpanzees performed at a table for the amusement of zoo visitors. They
<br>
were trained to use bowls, plates, spoons, cups and a teapot. For the
<br>
chimpanzee brain, learning to perform these trivial tasks provided only a
<br>
minor challenge. There was the ever-present danger that their table manners
<br>
would become too polished. To relieve the monotony, it often became necessary
<br>
to train them to 'misbehave'. They excelled at this, too, and their timing
<br>
became so perfect that the teacups were always popped into the teapot and the
<br>
tea drunk through the spout, just at the vital moment when the keeper turned
<br>
his back.&quot;
<br>
<p>To have apes ridicule our species, especially the cultural refinements that we
<br>
admire so greatly in ourselves, could be looked at as a form of
<br>
self-deprecation. That would be the optimistic view. The alternative is that
<br>
by allowing animals to mock us we let them make even greater fools of
<br>
themselves which permits us to laugh away any doubts we might harbour about
<br>
ourselves. That we select apes for this job is logical because it is
<br>
particularly in the face of animals similar to us that human uniqueness needs
<br>
confirmation.
<br>
<p>This is what makes Planet of the Apes so unique: instead of making fun of the
<br>
apes, it makes fun of us and puts us in the role of trying to prove that we
<br>
are less stupid than we look.
<br>
<p>All of this is not to say that I would love to live in a world dominated by
<br>
apes - like everyone else, I prefer to be on top.
<br>
<p>My whole point is that such a world would not necessarily be devoid of the
<br>
civilising tendencies that make our present lives bearable. Instead of being
<br>
ruled by robots or a bunch of piranhas, we would be at the mercy of
<br>
warm-blooded fellow primates who act, think and operate very much like us. It
<br>
would be an educational experience not unlike that of Rainer, the painter, who
<br>
discovered that the best way to get along with apes is to forget one's
<br>
prejudices and to heed their body language and sensitivities, which are
<br>
obviously from the same planet as ours.
