<em>&gt; I think the explanation is that the ants use external memory: instead of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to keep information in their tiny brains, they rely on chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markers. If an ant finds something tasty, it starts laying down a &quot;great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food this way&quot; trail on its way back to the anthill. Other ants follow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, and when they find tasty food they also start to lay down a trail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eventually a very strong and straight trail emerges, bringing lots of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ants.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In your case I guess it must have been the nectar and ambrosia of ants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they discovered, so they really poured on the trail. When the food
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vanished they still follwed it, and since they don't have a &quot;nothing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see here&quot; trail chemical it remained, diverting ants from more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; productive work. In time it will evaporate, but if there are traces of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the nectar nearby they might still be confused enough to replenish the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, might be useful for a &quot;nice&quot; pesticide: spray trail chemicals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around so that the ants will waste their resources. It will only work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ants, and perhaps only on a single species of ants, but it sounds really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ecologically friendly (with the caveat of removing the ants, of course).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian relevance: shows the power of spontaneous orders, and how a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very simple such order can sometimes go wrong. Foresight helps.

By MICHIKO KAKUTANI
<br>
Steven Johnson's 1997 book, &quot;Interface Culture,&quot; remains one of the most
<br>
thoughtful, literate studies yet published on the cultural impact of recent
<br>
technological changes. Writing in lucid, user-friendly prose and drawing
<br>
analogies from a prodigious range of fields (including literature, painting,
<br>
architecture, philosophy and semiotics), Mr. Johnson made the provocative
<br>
argument that the graphic interface - those software- mediated interactions
<br>
between users and computers - is potentially &quot;a medium as complex and vital as
<br>
the novel or the cathedral or the cinema.&quot; In much the same way that the
<br>
novels of Dickens attempted to make sense of the galvanic changes unleashed by
<br>
the Industrial Revolution, he suggested, today's high-tech interfaces are
<br>
providing us with tools to grapple with the dislocations and data overload
<br>
wrought by the information revolution.
<br>
<p>In his latest book, &quot;Emergence,&quot; Mr. Johnson, who is the editor in chief of
<br>
the online magazine Feed, focuses on a subject he touched on, in passing, in
<br>
that earlier book - namely, the phenomenon of self-organization, represented
<br>
by feedback systems and intelligent software that anticipates our needs. This
<br>
phenomenon, known as emergence, is embodied by &quot;bottom-up&quot; systems that use
<br>
&quot;relatively simple components to build higher-level intelligence.&quot; Ants build
<br>
complex colonies; city residents create distinct neighborhoods; simple pattern
<br>
recognition software learns to recommend new books or music based on our
<br>
previous choices. In each case, developments proceed not from some central
<br>
authority dictating plans from above but from the cumulative actions of
<br>
low-level agents below.
<br>
<p>Given the somewhat abstruse nature of emergence, this book tends to be less
<br>
immediately engaging than &quot;Interface Culture&quot; and more disorganized. Mr.
<br>
Johnson must spend a lot of time explaining the concept of emergence and
<br>
illustrating it with examples before he can look at its social implications,
<br>
and he frequently repeats the same information from slightly different angles.
<br>
Despite such difficulties, he once again demonstrates his range as a cultural
<br>
historian and his ability to make the reader see connections among
<br>
developments in fields as disparate as urban studies, evolutionary science and
<br>
artificial intelligence.
<br>
<p>In the course of &quot;Emergence,&quot; Mr. Johnson draws parallels between the &quot;climax
<br>
stage&quot; in city life - defined in the 1960's by Lewis Mumford as the point
<br>
beyond which a city cannot grow without suffering deterioration and a loss of
<br>
civic unity - and the runaway growth being sustained by Internet communities
<br>
today. He compares the changed expectations for rock music created by the
<br>
daring work of early groups like the Velvet Underground to the exciting new
<br>
possibilities being opened in the areas of software and game design by
<br>
innovators like Eric Zimmerman, who created the game Gearheads. And he
<br>
associates the collective intelligence exhibited by ant colonies (which,
<br>
contrary to popular belief, are not led or directed by a &quot;queen&quot;) with the
<br>
&quot;bottom-up powers of emergence&quot; exhibited by games like the best- selling
<br>
SimCity.
<br>
<p>Mr. Johnson argues that &quot;some of the great minds of the last few centuries -
<br>
Adam Smith, Friedrich Engels, Charles Darwin, Alan Turing - contributed to the
<br>
unknown science of self-organization, but because the science didn't exist yet
<br>
as a recognized field, their work ended up being filed on more familiar
<br>
shelves.&quot; &quot;They were wrestling with local issues, in clearly defined fields,&quot;
<br>
he writes. &quot;How ant colonies learn to forage and build nests; why industrial
<br>
neighborhoods form along class lines; how our minds learn to recognize faces.
<br>
You can answer all of these questions without resorting to the sciences of
<br>
complexity and self- organization, but those answers all share a common
<br>
pattern, as clear as the whorls of a fingerprint. But to see it as a pattern
<br>
you needed to encounter it in several contexts. Only when the pattern was
<br>
detected did people begin to think about studying self- organizing systems on
<br>
their own merits.&quot;
<br>
<p>That pattern was there to be found in studies looking at how our immune
<br>
systems &quot;learn throughout our lifetimes, building vocabularies of antibodies
<br>
that evolve in response to the threat posed by invading microorganisms.&quot; It
<br>
was there in research showing how cells in an embryo &quot;self-organize into more
<br>
complicated structures.&quot; And it was there in Jane Jacobs's descriptions of
<br>
cities as organisms, capable of adaptive change from the street level on up.
<br>
<p>In the last 10 years, Mr. Johnson observes, self-organizing systems have
<br>
increasingly become part of our everyday life: online stores like Amazon.com
<br>
have implemented them to track (and anticipate) our tastes, while Web sites
<br>
like eBay have adopted them to regulate relationships between buyers and
<br>
sellers. He predicts that personal digital television recorders like TiVo and
<br>
Replay, which enable people to decide what they want to watch and when they
<br>
want to watch it, will eventually lead to the demise of the network TV
<br>
programmer; and he argues that in the future, &quot;the entertainment world will
<br>
self-organize into clusters of shared interest, created by software that
<br>
tracks usage patterns and collates consumer ratings.&quot; As for
<br>
decentralization's effect on politics, Mr. Johnson points out that the
<br>
anti-globalization protest movement (made up of smaller affinity groups
<br>
representing specific causes) has already adopted a fragmented, leaderless
<br>
form reminiscent of ant colonies.
<br>
<p>This book does not convincingly illustrate the magnitude of change Mr. Johnson
<br>
attributes to the self- organization principle; he predicts that it will usher
<br>
in a revolution &quot;every bit as significant&quot; as the one unleashed by our
<br>
harnessing of electricity. But &quot;Emergence&quot; does limn some of its burgeoning
<br>
manifestations. And in doing so, it not only makes stimulating reading but
<br>
also goads us to appreciate the process whereby the parts often add up to more
<br>
than the whole.
