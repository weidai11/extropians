<p>The Media Must Demand Truth From the Testers
<br>
<p>by Thomas A. Halsted
<br>
<p>GLOUCESTER, Mass. -- For years, the Pentagon and its Ballistic Missile
<br>
Defense Organization have engaged in a continuing effort to delude the
<br>
public and Congress into believing the United States is well on its way to
<br>
developing a workable defense against ballistic missiles. Unfortunately, a
<br>
gullible news media have unwittingly played along.
<br>
<p>Now the truth is coming out. Last week, Air Force Lt. Gen. Ronald T. Kadish,
<br>
director of the missile-test organization, acknowledged that we don't yet
<br>
know how to hit a missile with another missile, let along distinguish enemy
<br>
warheads from decoys without radio aids. We are a long way from a national
<br>
missile defense and a testing program that focuses on the problems that such
<br>
a system must overcome.
<br>
<p>But the Pentagon has staged a series of show-biz events that have been
<br>
rigged to appear successful when, in fact, they prove next to nothing. Who
<br>
benefits from such deception? Not the president. Not the defense secretary.
<br>
Not U.S. allies. Certainly not the American people, who are no better
<br>
defended against a missile attack than they would be by holding a cheap
<br>
umbrella over their heads. The only clear winners are the missile-defense
<br>
system's principal contractors--Boeing Co., Raytheon Corp., TRW Inc. and
<br>
Lockheed Martin Corp.--and those among our enemies and detractors who might
<br>
seek to alienate the United States further from the rest of the world.
<br>
<p>The flight tests conducted so far have incorporated homing beacons,
<br>
unrealistic decoys and other techniques designed to create the appearance of
<br>
success. But these aids to detection and target discrimination can provide
<br>
no meaningful information to help a planner learn how to intercept a real
<br>
missile. Later revelations of flaws in the test data or manipulated data go
<br>
unreported. It's as though a baseball coach trained his outfielders with
<br>
nothing but pop flies aimed directly at them.
<br>
<p>The latest integrated flight test of a missile interceptor took place July
<br>
14 and was immediately trumpeted by the Bush administration as an
<br>
unqualified success. According to initial news accounts, the target, an
<br>
intercontinental ballistic missile warhead launched from Vandenberg Air
<br>
Force Base, was intercepted high over the Pacific Ocean and destroyed on
<br>
impact by an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) launched from Kwajalein Atoll
<br>
in the Marshall Islands. Reportedly, the EKV successfully identified and
<br>
ignored an accompanying decoy before homing in on the warhead to destroy it.
<br>
The evening television broadcasts showed cheering test personnel watching
<br>
the &quot;kill&quot; unfold on their monitors.
<br>
<p>Now the truth about the test, the fourth successive failure to conduct a
<br>
valid test of current missile-defense technology, is coming out. Less than a
<br>
week after the test, it was revealed that the Raytheon X-band radar, the
<br>
brains of the national missile defense system, had properly detected the
<br>
target warhead and provided data before the interception, but that its
<br>
data-analysis capability was then overwhelmed by the cloud of debris caused
<br>
by the collision of target and interceptor. The radar would thus have been
<br>
incapable of tracking any additional targets or discriminating between them
<br>
and any decoys, an essential task in any real attack scenario. This is a
<br>
major flaw. A missile defense system that can find and destroy only one
<br>
target is no defense at all.
<br>
<p>More recently, the journal Defense Week reported that the X-band radar was
<br>
able to detect and track the warhead, and distinguish it from the
<br>
accompanying decoy, because of a beacon implanted in the warhead that
<br>
emitted a stream of identifying radio signals. A Reuters dispatch reporting
<br>
on the Defense Week story has been largely ignored by media outlets.
<br>
<p>The July 14 test was no more useful than any of its predecessors at
<br>
providing data that would realistically simulate a real missile attack, but
<br>
the public doesn't know it largely because the media have not vigilantly
<br>
followed up on the original test. News people need to be more skeptical of
<br>
these tests. When they report on the front page or lead the television news
<br>
with a story that the Pentagon has conducted a successful missile-defense
<br>
test, then learn that the test was a failure or that test data were rigged,
<br>
they have an obligation to report the news as prominently as they reported
<br>
the original story. Instead, there has been near-silence.
<br>
<p>This is not to say that responsible voices have not been raised. Rep. John
<br>
F. Tierney (D-Mass.) recently forced a reluctant Pentagon to release an
<br>
unclassified report on the national missile defense test program prepared
<br>
last year by its own chief civilian test evaluator, Philip E. Coyle. The
<br>
Coyle report documents in detail the deceptive practices used, the failure
<br>
of tests to provide meaningful data on which to base any deployment
<br>
decisions and the failure to test against any realistic countermeasures an
<br>
actual missile defense would almost certainly encounter. The report includes
<br>
52 recommendations for improving the testing and evaluation program, not one
<br>
of which has been implemented. Regrettably, Tierney's release of the Coyle
<br>
report has been largely met by silence in the media.
<br>
<p>The day may soon come when Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will tell
<br>
President Bush that his experts have developed a defense system capable of
<br>
defending Americans citizens against a missile attack. Will he be willfully
<br>
deceiving the president? Will the president then order the abrogation of the
<br>
Antiballistic Missile Treaty and the deployment of a missile defense system
<br>
that almost certainly will be incapable of protecting the Americans he has
<br>
taken an oath to defend?
