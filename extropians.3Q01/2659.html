<br>
<p>By the way, the following, taken from
<br>
<a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-276.html">http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-276.html</a>
<br>
details how extremely greedy the Federal government has been with
<br>
land, keeping it out of production, just as so many famous people
<br>
(see first URL above) have complained.  My arithmetic (based on
<br>
the following) indicates that the Federal government owns 30% of
<br>
land in the United States.

<p>(1997) The Federal Estate
<br>
The federal government [in 1997] owns about 650 million acres of natural resource lands.
<br>
Aside from a few million acres managed by the Department of Defense, those lands are
<br>
nearly all managed by four agencies, three of which are in the Department of the Interior:
<br>
<p> The most valuable lands are the 192 million acres of national forests managed by the
<br>
Forest Service, which is in the Department of Agriculture;
<br>
<p> The most extensive lands are the 270 million acres managed by the Bureau of Land
<br>
Management (BLM) of the Department of the Interior;
<br>
<p> The most famous lands are the 80 million acres of parks, monuments, historic sites, and
<br>
recreation and other areas managed by the National Park Service of the Department of the
<br>
Interior;
<br>
<p> The most obscure lands are the 90 million acres of fish and wildlife refuges managed by
<br>
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, also in the Department of the Interior.
<br>
<p>A vast majority of those lands, including more than 75 percent of the national forest
<br>
acres, more than 90 percent of the national park acres, and more than 99 percent of the
<br>
BLM acres, are located in the 12 western states including Alaska.
