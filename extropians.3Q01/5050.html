<br>
<p>A Modest Proposal
<br>
For Preventing The Children of Poor People in Ireland
<br>
<em>&gt;From Being Aburden to Their Parents or Country, and
</em><br>
For Making Them Beneficial to The Public
<br>
Jonathan Swift
<br>
It is a melancholy object to those who walk through this great town or travel
<br>
in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and cabin doors, crowded
<br>
with beggars of the female sex, followed by three, four, or six children, all
<br>
in rags and importuning every passenger for an alms. These mothers, instead of
<br>
being able to work for their honest livelihood, are forced to employ all their
<br>
time in strolling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants: who as they
<br>
grow up either turn thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native
<br>
country to fight for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the
<br>
Barbadoes.
<br>
I think it is agreed by all parties that this prodigious number of children in
<br>
the arms, or on the backs, or at the heels of their mothers, and frequently of
<br>
their fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the kingdom a very great
<br>
additional grievance; and, therefore, whoever could find out a fair, cheap,
<br>
and easy method of making these children sound, useful members of the
<br>
commonwealth, would deserve so well of the public as to have his statue set up
<br>
for a preserver of the nation.
<br>
<p>But my intention is very far from being confined to provide only for the
<br>
children of professed beggars; it is of a much greater extent, and shall take
<br>
in the whole number of infants at a certain age who are born of parents in
<br>
effect as little able to support them as those who demand our charity in the
<br>
streets.
<br>
<p>As to my own part, having turned my thoughts for many years upon this
<br>
important subject, and maturely weighed the several schemes of other
<br>
projectors, I have always found them grossly mistaken in the computation. It
<br>
is true, a child just dropped from its dam may be supported by her milk for a
<br>
solar year, with little other nourishment; at most not above the value of 2s.,
<br>
which the mother may certainly get, or the value in scraps, by her lawful
<br>
occupation of begging; and it is exactly at one year old that I propose to
<br>
provide for them in such a manner as instead of being a charge upon their
<br>
parents or the parish, or wanting food and raiment for the rest of their
<br>
lives, they shall on the contrary contribute to the feeding, and partly to the
<br>
clothing, of many thousands.
<br>
<p>There is likewise another great advantage in my scheme, that it will prevent
<br>
those voluntary abortions, and that horrid practice of women murdering their
<br>
bastard children, alas! too frequent among us! sacrificing the poor innocent
<br>
babes I doubt more to avoid the expense than the shame, which would move tears
<br>
and pity in the most savage and inhuman breast.
<br>
<p>The number of souls in this kingdom being usually reckoned one million and a
<br>
half, of these I calculate there may be about two hundred thousand couple
<br>
whose wives are breeders; from which number I subtract thirty thousand couples
<br>
who are able to maintain their own children, although I apprehend there cannot
<br>
be so many, under the present distresses of the kingdom; but this being
<br>
granted, there will remain an hundred and seventy thousand breeders. I again
<br>
subtract fifty thousand for those women who miscarry, or whose children die by
<br>
accident or disease within the year. There only remains one hundred and twenty
<br>
thousand children of poor parents annually born. The question therefore is,
<br>
how this number shall be reared and provided for, which, as I have already
<br>
said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible by all the
<br>
methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or
<br>
agriculture; we neither build houses (I mean in the country) nor cultivate
<br>
land: they can very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing, till they arrive
<br>
at six years old, except where they are of towardly parts, although I confess
<br>
they learn the rudiments much earlier, during which time, they can however be
<br>
properly looked upon only as probationers, as I have been informed by a
<br>
principal gentleman in the county of Cavan, who protested to me that he never
<br>
knew above one or two instances under the age of six, even in a part of the
<br>
kingdom so renowned for the quickest proficiency in that art.
<br>
<p>I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years old is
<br>
no salable commodity; and even when they come to this age they will not yield
<br>
above three pounds, or three pounds and half-a-crown at most on the exchange;
<br>
which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of
<br>
nutriment and rags having been at least four times that value.
<br>
<p>I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be
<br>
liable to the least objection.
<br>
<p>I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,
<br>
that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious,
<br>
nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and
<br>
I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.
<br>
<p>I do therefore humbly offer it to public consideration that of the hundred and
<br>
twenty thousand children already computed, twenty thousand may be reserved for
<br>
breed, whereof only one-fourth part to be males; which is more than we allow
<br>
to sheep, black cattle or swine; and my reason is, that these children are
<br>
seldom the fruits of marriage, a circumstance not much regarded by our
<br>
savages, therefore one male will be sufficient to serve four females. That the
<br>
remaining hundred thousand may, at a year old, be offered in the sale to the
<br>
persons of quality and fortune through the kingdom; always advising the mother
<br>
to let them suck plentifully in the last month, so as to render them plump and
<br>
fat for a good table. A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for
<br>
friends; and when the family dines alone, the fore or hind quarter will make a
<br>
reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt will be very good
<br>
boiled on the fourth day, especially in winter.
<br>
<p>I have reckoned upon a medium that a child just born will weigh 12 pounds, and
<br>
in a solar year, if tolerably nursed, increaseth to 28 pounds.
<br>
<p>I grant this food will be somewhat dear, and therefore very proper for
<br>
landlords, who, as they have already devoured most of the parents, seem to
<br>
have the best title to the children.
<br>
<p>Infant's flesh will be in season throughout the year, but more plentiful in
<br>
March, and a little before and after; for we are told by a grave author, an
<br>
eminent French physician, that fish being a prolific diet, there are more
<br>
children born in Roman Catholic countries about nine months after Lent than at
<br>
any other season; therefore, reckoning a year after Lent, the markets will be
<br>
more glutted than usual, because the number of popish infants is at least
<br>
three to one in this kingdom: and therefore it will have one other collateral
<br>
advantage, by lessening the number of papists among us.
<br>
<p>I have already computed the charge of nursing a beggar's child (in which list
<br>
I reckon all cottagers, laborers, and four-fifths of the farmers) to be about
<br>
two shillings per annum, rags included; and I believe no gentleman would
<br>
repine to give ten shillings for the carcass of a good fat child, which, as I
<br>
have said, will make four dishes of excellent nutritive meat, when he hath
<br>
only some particular friend or his own family to dine with him. Thus the
<br>
squire will learn to be a good landlord, and grow popular among his tenants;
<br>
the mother will have eight shillings net profit, and be fit for work till she
<br>
produces another child.
<br>
<p>Those who are more thrifty (as I must confess the times require) may flay the
<br>
carcass; the skin of which artificially dressed will make admirable gloves for
<br>
ladies, and summer boots for fine gentlemen.
<br>
<p>As to our city of Dublin, shambles may be appointed for this purpose in the
<br>
most convenient parts of it, and butchers we may be assured will not be
<br>
wanting; although I rather recommend buying the children alive, and dressing
<br>
them hot from the knife, as we do roasting pigs.
<br>
<p>A very worthy person, a true lover of his country, and whose virtues I highly
<br>
esteem, was lately pleased in discoursing on this matter to offer a refinement
<br>
upon my scheme. He said that many gentlemen of this kingdom, having of late
<br>
destroyed their deer, he conceived that the want of venison might be well
<br>
supplied by the bodies of young lads and maidens, not exceeding fourteen years
<br>
of age nor under twelve; so great a number of both sexes in every country
<br>
being now ready to starve for want of work and service; and these to be
<br>
disposed of by their parents, if alive, or otherwise by their nearest
<br>
relations. But with due deference to so excellent a friend and so deserving a
<br>
patriot, I cannot be altogether in his sentiments; for as to the males, my
<br>
American acquaintance assured me, from frequent experience, that their flesh
<br>
was generally tough and lean, like that of our schoolboys by continual
<br>
exercise, and their taste disagreeable; and to fatten them would not answer
<br>
the charge. Then as to the females, it would, I think, with humble submission
<br>
be a loss to the public, because they soon would become breeders themselves;
<br>
and besides, it is not improbable that some scrupulous people might be apt to
<br>
censure such a practice (although indeed very unjustly), as a little bordering
<br>
upon cruelty; which, I confess, hath always been with me the strongest
<br>
objection against any project, however so well intended.
<br>
<p>But in order to justify my friend, he confessed that this expedient was put
<br>
into his head by the famous Psalmanazar, a native of the island Formosa, who
<br>
came from thence to London above twenty years ago, and in conversation told my
<br>
friend, that in his country when any young person happened to be put to death,
<br>
the executioner sold the carcass to persons of quality as a prime dainty; and
<br>
that in his time the body of a plump girl of fifteen, who was crucified for an
<br>
attempt to poison the emperor, was sold to his imperial majesty's prime
<br>
minister of state, and other great mandarins of the court, in joints from the
<br>
gibbet, at four hundred crowns. Neither indeed can I deny, that if the same
<br>
use were made of several plump young girls in this town, who without one
<br>
single groat to their fortunes cannot stir abroad without a chair, and appear
<br>
at playhouse and assemblies in foreign fineries which they never will pay for,
<br>
the kingdom would not be the worse.
<br>
<p>Some persons of a desponding spirit are in great concern about that vast
<br>
number of poor people, who are aged, diseased, or maimed, and I have been
<br>
desired to employ my thoughts what course may be taken to ease the nation of
<br>
so grievous an encumbrance. But I am not in the least pain upon that matter,
<br>
because it is very well known that they are every day dying and rotting by
<br>
cold and famine, and filth and vermin, as fast as can be reasonably expected.
<br>
And as to the young laborers, they are now in as hopeful a condition; they
<br>
cannot get work, and consequently pine away for want of nourishment, to a
<br>
degree that if at any time they are accidentally hired to common labor, they
<br>
have not strength to perform it; and thus the country and themselves are
<br>
happily delivered from the evils to come.
<br>
<p>I have too long digressed, and therefore shall return to my subject. I think
<br>
the advantages by the proposal which I have made are obvious and many, as well
<br>
as of the highest importance.
<br>
<p>For first, as I have already observed, it would greatly lessen the number of
<br>
papists, with whom we are yearly overrun, being the principal breeders of the
<br>
nation as well as our most dangerous enemies; and who stay at home on purpose
<br>
with a design to deliver the kingdom to the Pretender, hoping to take their
<br>
advantage by the absence of so many good protestants, who have chosen rather
<br>
to leave their country than stay at home and pay tithes against their
<br>
conscience to an episcopal curate.
<br>
<p>Secondly, The poorer tenants will have something valuable of their own, which
<br>
by law may be made liable to distress and help to pay their landlord's rent,
<br>
their corn and cattle being already seized, and money a thing unknown.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, Whereas the maintenance of an hundred thousand children, from two
<br>
years old and upward, cannot be computed at less than ten shillings a-piece
<br>
per annum, the nation's stock will be thereby increased fifty thousand pounds
<br>
per annum, beside the profit of a new dish introduced to the tables of all
<br>
gentlemen of fortune in the kingdom who have any refinement in taste. And the
<br>
money will circulate among ourselves, the goods being entirely of our own
<br>
growth and manufacture.
<br>
<p>Fourthly, The constant breeders, beside the gain of eight shillings sterling
<br>
per annum by the sale of their children, will be rid of the charge of
<br>
maintaining them after the first year.
<br>
<p>Fifthly, This food would likewise bring great custom to taverns; where the
<br>
vintners will certainly be so prudent as to procure the best receipts for
<br>
dressing it to perfection, and consequently have their houses frequented by
<br>
all the fine gentlemen, who justly value themselves upon their knowledge in
<br>
good eating: and a skilful cook, who understands how to oblige his guests,
<br>
will contrive to make it as expensive as they please.
<br>
<p>Sixthly, This would be a great inducement to marriage, which all wise nations
<br>
have either encouraged by rewards or enforced by laws and penalties. It would
<br>
increase the care and tenderness of mothers toward their children, when they
<br>
were sure of a settlement for life to the poor babes, provided in some sort by
<br>
the public, to their annual profit instead of expense. We should see an honest
<br>
emulation among the married women, which of them could bring the fattest child
<br>
to the market. Men would become as fond of their wives during the time of
<br>
their pregnancy as they are now of their mares in foal, their cows in calf,
<br>
their sows when they are ready to farrow; nor offer to beat or kick them (as
<br>
is too frequent a practice) for fear of a miscarriage.
<br>
<p>Many other advantages might be enumerated. For instance, the addition of some
<br>
thousand carcasses in our exportation of barreled beef, the propagation of
<br>
swine's flesh, and improvement in the art of making good bacon, so much wanted
<br>
among us by the great destruction of pigs, too frequent at our tables; which
<br>
are no way comparable in taste or magnificence to a well-grown, fat, yearling
<br>
child, which roasted whole will make a considerable figure at a lord mayor's
<br>
feast or any other public entertainment. But this and many others I omit,
<br>
being studious of brevity.
<br>
<p><p>***
<br>
After all, I am not so violently bent upon my own opinion as to reject any
<br>
offer proposed by wise men, which shall be found equally innocent, cheap,
<br>
easy, and effectual. But before something of that kind shall be advanced in
<br>
contradiction to my scheme, and offering a better, I desire the author or
<br>
authors will be pleased maturely to consider two points. First, as things now
<br>
stand, how they will be able to find food and raiment for an hundred thousand
<br>
useless mouths and backs. And secondly, there being a round million of
<br>
creatures in human figure throughout this kingdom, whose whole subsistence put
<br>
into a common stock would leave them in debt two millions of pounds sterling,
<br>
adding those who are beggars by profession to the bulk of farmers, cottagers,
<br>
and laborers, with their wives and children who are beggars in effect: I
<br>
desire those politicians who dislike my overture, and may perhaps be so bold
<br>
as to attempt an answer, that they will first ask the parents of these
<br>
mortals, whether they would not at this day think it a great happiness to have
<br>
been sold for food, at a year old in the manner I prescribe, and thereby have
<br>
avoided such a perpetual scene of misfortunes as they have since gone through
<br>
by the oppression of landlords, the impossibility of paying rent without money
<br>
or trade, the want of common sustenance, with neither house nor clothes to
<br>
cover them from the inclemencies of the weather, and the most inevitable
<br>
prospect of entailing the like or greater miseries upon their breed for ever.
<br>
<p>I profess, in the sincerity of my heart, that I have not the least personal
<br>
interest in endeavoring to promote this necessary work, having no other motive
<br>
than the public good of my country, by advancing our trade, providing for
<br>
infants, relieving the poor, and giving some pleasure to the rich. I have no
<br>
children by which I can propose to get a single penny; the youngest being nine
<br>
years old, and my wife past child-bearing.
